<p>After having experienced the hustle and bustle of Bangalore, the next plan was
to explore Kerala, a state which is located on the tropical south-western tip of
the subcontinent. On its coast it is home to vast stretches of palm tree adorned
beaches, which are flanked by rice fields criss-crossed by small canals, just as
in Venice. Going further inland, one meets the mighty <em>Western Ghats</em> mountain
range, a high-altitude rainforest, home to elephants and tigers, which is ideal
for escaping the oppressive humidity on the coast. Politically, it is also
well-known within India for its high degree of development‚Äìit has the highest
literacy rates, life expectancy and lowest impoverishment rates in the country.
All great things. And they also love a bit of communism too it turns out.</p>

<p>Bangalore, which is known as India‚Äôs ‚Äúsilicon valley‚Äù, was my first port of call
for my trip to India. It was the winter semester break and I had just been
travelling around Venice and Triest, so my mind was hitherto occupied with the
calm and cultured sights of northern Italy. However, this collected state
disappeared as soon as my first night in India, when my
long-neglected sense of culture shock arose again and brought me back into the
present with the overwhelming feeling of newness that all travelers crave.</p>

<p>I was returning to Triest on the coach, when overhead a troupe of fighter jets
flew right over us, emanating smoke trails in the colours of the Italian flag
behind them. Needless to say this was quite a surprise! It was because there
turned out to be a major event occurring in Triest on that weekend: the return of
the Amerigo Vespucci to Italy after a two-year long tour around the world.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve long been putting off visiting Venice as it has a reputation of being one
of the most touristy places on Earth. It‚Äôs known as a place where the streets
are clogged with Chinese and American group tours and everything is absurdly
expensive to match. Then there‚Äôs the government‚Äôs response to the
overtourism‚Äìfleece the tourists even more. Nope, neither of those sound
particularly appealing. However, now that I live in Munich, it‚Äôs pretty easy to
get a coach there and it‚Äôs not only cheap, but traverses some of the most
beautiful countryside in Europe on the way there as it goes directly through the
Alps on the Brenner Pass. So clearly it was finally time to make the plunge and
visit.</p>

            <p>I previously (probably like many ‚Äúold-skool‚Äù C++ devs) thought of cloud computing
primarily as renting other peoples‚Äô machines at a high mark-up. However, I‚Äôve
been reading up on papers in the databases research
field and so thought I would share some of my findings. The use-case I will be talking about here is how
modern OLTP databases are designed for the cloud and their corresponding
advantages.</p>

that was made in Leningrad in the mid 1980s.</p>

<p>After a year‚Äôs hiatus from playing electric guitar (I usually play fingerstyle
pieces on my acoustic nowadays), I had rediscovered my baby blue Tanglewood
Stratocaster, which was my first guitar. I had already modded it to the stage
where not much of the original guitar remained. The bridge was replaced by a MiM
Fender one, the tuners are now retro-style Washburn tuners, and similarly the pickups have
also been long since replaced by some nice ‚ÄúWarman‚Äù pickups made by a bloke in Wales.</p>

<p>Despite Oman having a long history, there wasn‚Äôt much evident of it in the
capital city Muscat, which is a city caught between being a hectic
middle-eastern metropolis and a resort town for rich oil-sheiks, depending on
where you are and your station in life. Therefore, in search of some history, I
took a coach out to Nizwa, a major city and oasis town in the desert interior of
the country.</p>
