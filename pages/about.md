I'm Dan Vonk.

But you probably already knew that from the big writing up on the left
hand-side. Perhaps you didn't know that I am an Australian, living in London and
working as a software engineer at KDAB, a small firm doing C++/Qt training and
consulting. And what's more is I currently work in the C++ programming language
but also have an interest in Rust as well as various functional languages! To be
even more prescriptive, I enjoy graphics-related programming and maintain a bit
of an interest in programming language and proof theory.
