<p>After having experienced the hustle and bustle of Bangalore, the next plan was
to explore Kerala, a state which is located on the tropical south-western tip of
the subcontinent. On its coast it is home to vast stretches of palm tree adorned
beaches, which are flanked by rice fields criss-crossed by small canals, just as
in Venice. Going further inland, one meets the mighty <em>Western Ghats</em> mountain
range, a high-altitude rainforest, home to elephants and tigers, which is ideal
for escaping the oppressive humidity on the coast. Politically, it is also
well-known within India for its high degree of development‚Äìit has the highest
literacy rates, life expectancy and lowest impoverishment rates in the country.
All great things. And they also love a bit of communism too it turns out.</p>

<p>Bangalore, which is known as India‚Äôs ‚Äúsilicon valley‚Äù, was my first port of call
for my trip to India. It was the winter semester break and I had just been
travelling around Venice and Triest, so my mind was hitherto occupied with the
calm and cultured sights of northern Italy. However, this collected state
disappeared as soon as my first night in India, when my
long-neglected sense of culture shock arose again and brought me back into the
present with the overwhelming feeling of newness that all travelers crave.</p>

<p>I was returning to Triest on the coach, when overhead a troupe of fighter jets
flew right over us, emanating smoke trails in the colours of the Italian flag
behind them. Needless to say this was quite a surprise! It was because there
turned out to be a major event occurring in Triest on that weekend: the return of
the Amerigo Vespucci to Italy after a two-year long tour around the world.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve long been putting off visiting Venice as it has a reputation of being one
of the most touristy places on Earth. It‚Äôs known as a place where the streets
are clogged with Chinese and American group tours and everything is absurdly
expensive to match. Then there‚Äôs the government‚Äôs response to the
overtourism‚Äìfleece the tourists even more. Nope, neither of those sound
particularly appealing. However, now that I live in Munich, it‚Äôs pretty easy to
get a coach there and it‚Äôs not only cheap, but traverses some of the most
beautiful countryside in Europe on the way there as it goes directly through the
Alps on the Brenner Pass. So clearly it was finally time to make the plunge and
visit.</p>

<p>Despite Oman having a long history, there wasn‚Äôt much evident of it in the
capital city Muscat, which is a city caught between being a hectic
middle-eastern metropolis and a resort town for rich oil-sheiks, depending on
where you are and your station in life. Therefore, in search of some history, I
took a coach out to Nizwa, a major city and oasis town in the desert interior of
the country.</p>

<p>Mustcat, Oman, is a busy city of about one and a half million people. In districts like
Al-Gubrah, it has wide, traffic-jammed boulevards lined with tall concrete
buildings. There often isn‚Äôt any pavement but instead the side of the road is a
car park for the shops on the ground floor. The sun was scorching when I
visited in October and the temperature around 39c. Therefore, I wanted to stay
in the shade as much as possible and that meant keeping close to the shop
fronts. However, the more I walked around, the more amusing I found the names of
the shops!</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the trip to Kyrgyzstan was taking the UAZ, the
go-anywhere vehicle, up into the remote fringes of the country. It was the type
of journey for which the van was designed and I was not disappointed! The
scenery encountered along the way remains some of the best I‚Äôve ever seen and
being able to drive around essentially anywhere unrestricted or meeting
much sign of human life remains a priceless experience for me.</p>
<p>The aim of the journey was to see Kol‚Äôsu lake, an alpine lake hidden
between the peaks of the central Tian Shan mountain range, which separate
Kyrgyzstan from China. The lake itself sits at an elevation of 3514 metres.
The lake itself has an air of mystical quality about it: Kol‚Äôsu was formed by a
seismic event in the 1970s and has no proper outflow. Nevertheless water
manages to escape underground through cracks in the rock formations and through soil. This
causes it to occasionally dry out entirely, before it can be resupplied by the
Kurumduk river.</p>

<p>On my recent trip to Kyrgyzstan, one of the highlights was the beautiful
Barskoon Valley. On the south shore of Lake Issyk-Kul, sits the town of Barskoon
and this road brings you up into the Tien-Shan mountains and beyond. Somewhat
unusual for Kyrgyzstan, is that this road doesn‚Äôt totally suck! We managed to do
about 90 km/h in our UAZ on this dirt track, while we could only manage about 20
km/h when we were travelling in the south of the country around Naryn.</p>

<p>After a long winter and a damp spring, by April, it was finally time for a
holiday and the chosen venue this time was Morocco. For me, there is a particular
allure to leaving Europe and vacationing in a new continent and I have barely
scratched the surface of Africa so far in my life. Furthermore, the decision to travel to
Morocco was further spurred on by the fact that Ryanair flew to several
destinations in the country for less than $40, which is certainly a price that
can‚Äôt be argued with! Amongst those options, my friend and I chose to fly to
Essaouira, a small fishing town on the Atlantic coast, about midway down the
length of the country.</p>

            <p>In August 2022, I spent a couple of weeks visiting the office in Berlin and decided
to take my Zorki-4K camera with me. I found a couple of rolls of Kodak <em>ColorPlus</em> in <em>DM</em>, so
decided to use that to capture my explorations of the city in my free-time.
Although ColorPlus is known as a cheap film, I was pleased with the results and although
it doesn‚Äôt have the fine detail of Kodak <em>Portra</em>, I think the colour reproduction is very near
as good. The following blog entry describes a bit of the back-story behind these photos.</p>

<p>The best photo I have taken has to be the one shown above, which I took in September 2019. I was travelling with a friend
from San Francisco, down to L.A. and then back up again. We had rented a Nissan pick-up truck, or really I should, as a self-respecting
Aussie, say Ute, which was of course a novelty for us compared to the ‚Äúeuro shitboxes‚Äù one mostly sees back at home. We were around
the Yosemite / Death Valley area and had found a lay-by off a forest road which was in an isolated spot, perched up on the gentle
gradient leading down to Mono Lake in the distance.</p>

<p>Already preceding my entry into Armenia, had I heard accusations and assertions
about this place. It was on the train journey to Kars, a town in Turkey, near
to the border with Armenia, had we been conversing with a Turkish man who, when
we told him we were going to Armenia, made sure to explain that we would
hear much about the Armenian genocide, but that it simply wasn‚Äôt true. After
all, the Ottoman Empire was a powerful entity, he stressed to us, surely if they
wanted to exterminate the Armenian people, they would have done so thoroughly
and without any half-measures?</p>

<p>Georgia is a land of stunning geography but one of the highlights for me was our
tour starting in the capital and driving the <em>Military Highway</em> through the
Caucuses mountains up to Gudauri, which is a ski resort town. This road is
steeped in the history of the region, having been used by invaders and merchants since at
least the first century BC.</p>

<p>In November of 2022, I headed to Ankara for a two-week adventure through Turkey
and the Caucuses with a friend that I have known for many years. It had been a
trip months in the making, though it started with a humble suggestion during a
Discord chat one evening. Both being relatively early into our careers, we did
not have the luxury of spending money on long-haul flights to the U.S., a week‚Äôs
worth of hotels in an expensive state as well as the petrol needed to get us
around. Nor did the idea of staying in Europe and going to museums sound all
that excited to us adventure-seekers. So instead, it was more a question of how
far we could go for the least money and luckily, through browsing on Google
Flights, we found short-haul flights to Ankara that fit the description well. So
our destination had now become Ankara. But ask any Turk and they will tell you
that there isn‚Äôt much to see in this city. Therefore, we decided to take the
night train across the country and continue this journey into the Caucuses,
which I‚Äôll probably describe in a further blog post.</p>
