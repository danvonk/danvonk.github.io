        <p>In August 2022, I spent a couple of weeks visiting the office in Berlin and decided
to take my Zorki-4K camera with me. I found a couple of rolls of Kodak <em>ColorPlus</em> in <em>DM</em>, so
decided to use that to capture my explorations of the city in my free-time.
Although ColorPlus is known as a cheap film, I was pleased with the results and although
it doesn’t have the fine detail of Kodak <em>Portra</em>, I think the colour reproduction is very near
as good. The following blog entry describes a bit of the back-story behind these photos.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For the duration of my time in Berlin, I was staying in Pankow-Süd, just moments
away from the U-Bahn station of <em>Vinetastraße</em>. For Berliners, this is considered to be in Narnia
as it’s outside of the <em>Ringbahn</em>, the S-Bahn that encircles the core of the city. However, it was
easy enough to walk to one of the stations on the ring and being so close to a metro station, with
which I could reach the city centre in under 20 mins, was a contrast to where I live currently,
in the real boonies on the very fringes of the greater London area.</p>
<p>The AirBnb that I was staying in was an <em>Altbau</em>. These are apartment buildings constructed during the <em>Gruenderzeit</em>,
which began in 1873, with the unification of Germany and lasted till WW1. This was a time when industrialisation
came into full swing in Germany, where it overtook Britain as the foremost power in Europe in this regard, as well
as in science and culture. Predictably then, the buildings of this time are ornate, with almost 4M high ceilings,
beautiful facades and large rooms. They are a joy to be in, especially during Summer, when natural light streams
in through their large windows and one can sit on their spacious balconies and observe the goings-on in the city from above.</p>
<p>But back to the pictures… Due to it being a major hub for the U-Bahn, the first place I visited was <em>Alexanderplatz</em>, this is a large open plaza in the former eastern zone of Berlin. It was completely reconstructed after the second world war by the communist authorities and as such it’s surrounded by large, blocky
brutalist buildings, which have now become department stores like <em>Galeria Kaufhof</em> and other mass-market shops. Although the
famous TV tower is not actually on the <em>Alex</em>, it is one of the major attractions here. I usually think TV towers are a bit
ugly, but I have to admit, I do quite like this one!</p>

<p>I continued my walk here on the Karl-Marx Allee. This was one of the preeminent streets of the eastern zone. It is a wide
boulevard lined with large apartment buildings in the <em>Stalinist Architecture</em> style. This isn’t to be confused with the
typical communist, brutalist style that came later but instead is intricate and almost classical in appearance. Other than
that, there were also some nice <em>Bauhaus</em> buildings, but I’m not usually such a fan.</p>
<p>After a while of walking down this street, you will eventually reach
<em>Friedrichshain</em>. Friedrichshain (and neighbouring Kreuzberg) is one of the original ‘cool’
parts of Berlin, famed for its night-life as well as being one of the old artsy
centres of the city. However, nowadays it’s getting expensive and developed with
many new office blocks under construction. On the day I was there, the famous flea
market was on at the <em>RAW Gelaende</em>, which sells second-hand clothes, so you can
get that trash-chic vibe that Berlin is known for. The assortment was a lot
better for women’s clothes, the prices were high and I reckon you could do a lot
better at a charity shop anywhere in London.</p>

<p>In this area, on the banks of the Spree is the <em>Mauer Gallerie</em>, which shows a
preserved section of the Berlin wall (there are several other less touristy
places to see it) with various iconic artworks. There’s also the
<em>Oberbaumbrücke</em> around here, which is a beautiful draw-bridge connecting
Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg (they were previously on opposing sides of the
Berlin wall).</p>

<p>The day after, I headed over to Potsdam, which is just outside of Berlin (sort
of a Windsor/Versailles/Pushkin situation). The landscape is very beautiful here
(at least in the summer) as the Havel and Spree create many large lakes, all
surrounded by forest, which one passes over on the elevated
railway tracks on the way to Potsdam. Needless to say, it surpasses anything the
so-called “areas of outstanding natural beauty” that exist around London.
Frederick the Great had his palace here and the grounds provide a nice escape on
the weekends, with manicured gardens and multiple palaces!</p>
