edgy neighbourhood in Bangalore.")

Bangalore, which is known as India's "silicon valley", was my first port of call
for my trip to India. It was the winter semester break and I had just been
travelling around Venice and Triest, so my mind was hitherto occupied with the
calm and cultured sights of northern Italy. However, this collected state
disappeared as soon as my first night in India, when my
long-neglected sense of culture shock arose again and brought me back into the
present with the overwhelming feeling of newness that all travelers crave.

I had arrived in the early hours of the morning and had therefore booked
accommodation in a village close to the airport, a place I affectionately called
the Luton of Bangalore. Getting there was easy enough, it was just a matter of
booking an Uber using the airport's Wi-Fi. However, the driver dropped me off on
a dirt road underneath the busy motorway underpass, just outside the village. I
had to walk about 20 minutes in the darkness, alongside the typical roadside
rubbish, all the while the street dogs glared suspiciously at me. Some detours
were made to avoid the barking ones as it was too early in the holiday to open
that can of worms. Of course, I gave the Uber driver 5 stars--I _mean_ he has to
earn a living.

The hotel itself was fine enough, a little scruffy, but that is more or less the
norm there unless you go for something properly fancy, in which case, it gets
truly fancy. Though even at this modest hotel, the breakfast menu was just
great. In weeks previous, I acclimated to indulging on Italian-style filled
croissants with a cappuccino but this was far better. In the beginning, the
items were all quite mysterious. Various curries, sometimes red and sometimes
white. Deep-fried dough and flying saucer shaped objects to go with. Not to
forget the masala chai: was that cardamom and cloves I was tasting in there or
was it cinnamon and ginger? No, it turns out it's everything! In the next few
weeks, I became a lot more familiar with the items and soon knew my idli
from my vada and my coconut chutney from my sambar. Though if there was one
common theme, it was that almost every meal was absurdly spicy.

After experiencing Luton, it was time to level up to the city proper, so I took
another Uber to meet my friend in Majestic, which is more or less right in the
middle of that endless agglomeration of buildings and people called Bangalore!
Needless to say, about half of the Uber ride was just spent sitting in the heat
and traffic. Watching the mad exploits of the auto-rickshaw drivers as they wove
their way through the mass of bumper to bumper, stacked cars was more than
enough entertainment to make up for it though.

The area around Majestic is just as busy, even though I had read in the paper
that the hoteliers were saying it's seen better days. The streets here are
narrow and what space the pavements do provide is usually occupied by street
vendors or building works, meaning one has to compete on the asphalt with the
autos and motorbikes. I don't want to paint things too negatively though as I
actually really liked Bangalore! One such reason why was the amount of
restaurants and that they were all quite good value (approximately â‚¬1 per meal).
Later on in the trip, in Kerala, we would enjoy some great local delicacies in
exotic locations perched up in the mountains, but in big cities like Bangalore,
one is simply spoiled for choice and for low prices too. It wasn't just south
Indian food available either--I tried some Jain food as well as some Goan food
(Vindaloo) and found them both delicious. Bangalore is also famous for its
nightlife in India and whilst it isn't remotely comparable to London or Berlin,
it wasn't bad either, especially as I got the feeling that bars and public
drinking in general is more of an imported, western concept^[After trying
locally-made, distributed in coke bottles coconut wine in Kerala, I learnt more
about the historical Hindu beliefs about the impurity of alcohol, which therefore
confined distillers and brewers to being untouchable, so it makes sense that drinking would be
traditionally confined to the home and would be reflected in the culture.].

Eventually, it was time to see some sights outside of the big city, for which we
decided to take a train to Mysore, a city that is a couple of hours west of
Bangalore. Despite popular conceptions about rail travel in India, we happened
to take the new business express train, which makes the long journey from
Chennai through Bangalore and onto the west coast and is about as modern as any
regional train in Europe. Clean and nice. However, on the way back, we
experienced more of the "classic" Indian train journey experience: a sleeping
carriage with bunks chok full people sitting, laying and generally hanging from
the ceiling. The windows were open-frame (no glass) and the doors were kept open
during the entire trip, which provided a nice breeze as well as the opportunity
to stick your head out and catch a nice view (if you dared). Though despite this
breeze and the many ceiling fans, it was still obnoxiously hot inside. But at least one
didn't have to go unrefreshed on this train, as every 10 minutes, an attendant would
walk down the gangway, shouting "water", "coffee/tea" or whichever snacks he was
selling at maximum volume to overcome the clack-clack of the train along the
tracks. I have to admit, it was good service but quite annoying if you're trying
to decompress after a long day out and about. The snacks definitely fell into
the "DO NOT EAT STREETFOOD!" category that everyone warns you about--there was
definitely not much in the way of sanitary precautions being taken.

Back to Mysore: The city is known as the "cultural and intellectual" centre of
Karnataka^[The state was previously known as _Mysore State_.]. But I suppose
we're not so much into that milieu, so we took a quick look at the place and
then headed to our main destination _Srirangapatna_, a small village nearby
which contains some important historical sites. The first was one of Tipu
Sultan's palaces, which is an ornate teak pavilion in the Indo-Islamic style,
surrounded by green lawns and towering giant Rain trees. It was pleasant but more of
a country house than anything superior and regal. The second was the wonderful
Ranganathaswamy temple--built in the 10th century. Entering it felt like going
into a subterranean lair: low stone ceilings, held up by intricately carved
columns which kept most of the light and heat out and lots of incense. I'm not
very keyed into how one prays at these temples, but there seems to be an awful
lot more queuing than actually seeing the altars and shrines!
