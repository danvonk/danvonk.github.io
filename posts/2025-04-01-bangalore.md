edgy neighbourhood in Bangalore.")

Bangalore, which is known as India's "silicon valley", was my first port of call
for my trip to India. It was the winter semester break and I had just been
travelling around Venice and Triest, so my mind was hitherto occupied with the
calm and cultured sights of northern Italy. However, this collected state
quickly absconded even as soon as my first night in India, when my
long-neglected feeling of culture shock arose and prompted me to realise that
this would be another truly great holiday.

I had arrived in the early hours of the morning and had therefore booked
accommodation in a village close to the airport, a place I affectionately called
the Luton of Bangalore. Getting there was easy enough, it was just a matter of
booking an Uber using the airport's Wi-Fi. However, the driver dropped me off on
a dirt road underneath the busy motorway underpass, just outside the village. I
had to walk about 20 minutes in the darkness, alongside the typical roadside
rubbish, all the while the street dogs glared suspiciously at me. Some detours
were made to avoid the barking ones as it was too early in the holiday to open
that can of worms. Of course, I gave the Uber driver 5 stars--I _mean_ he has to
earn a living.

The hotel itself was fine enough, a little scruffy, but that is more or less the
norm there unless you go for something properly fancy, in which case, it gets
truly fancy. Though even at this modest hotel, the breakfast menu was just
great. In weeks previous, I acclimated to indulging on Italian-style filled
croissants with a cappuccino but this was far better. In the beginning, the
items were all quite mysterious. Various curries, sometimes red and sometimes
white. Deep-fried dough and flying saucer shaped objects to go with. Not to
forget the masala chai: was that cardamom and cloves I was tasting in there or
was it cinnamon and ginger? No, it turns out it's everything! In the next few
weeks, I became a lot more familiar with the items and was soon knew my idli
from my vada and my coconut chutney from my sambar. Though if there was one
common theme, it was that almost every meal was absurdly spicy.

After experiencing Luton, it was time to level up to the city proper, so I took
another Uber to meet my friend in Majestic, which is more or less right in the
middle of that endless agglomeration of buildings and people called Bangalore!
Needless to say, about half of the Uber ride was just spent sitting in the heat
and traffic. Watching the mad exploits of the auto-rickshaw drivers as they wove
their way through the mass of bumper to bumper, stacked cars was more than
enough entertainment to make up for it though.

The area around Majestic is just as busy, even though I had read in the paper
that the hoteliers were saying it's seen better days. The streets here are
narrow and what space the pavements do provide is usually occupied by street
vendors or building works, meaning one has to compete on the asphalt with the
autos and motorbikes. I don't want to paint things too negatively though as I
actually really liked Bangalore! One such reason why was the amount of
restaurants and that they were all quite good value (approximately €1 per meal).
Later on in the trip, in Kerala, we would enjoy some great local delicacies in
exotic locations perched up in the mountains, but in big cities like Bangalore,
one is simply spoiled for choice and for low prices too. It wasn't just south
Indian food available either--I tried some Jain food as well as some Goan food
(Vindaloo) and found them both delicious. Bangalore is also famous for its
nightlife in India and whilst it isn't remotely comparable to London or Berlin,
it wasn't bad either, especially as I got the feeling that bars and public
drinking in general is more of a imported, western concept^[After trying
locally-made, distributed in coke bottles coconut wine in Kerala, I learnt more
about the historical Hindu beliefs about the impurity of alcohol, which therefore
confined distillers and brewers to being untouchable, so it makes sense that drinking would be
traditionally confined to the home and would be reflected in the culture.].

Eventually, it was time to see some sights outside of the big city, which
required taking a train to Mysore, a city that is a few hours west of Bangalore.
It's known as the "cultural and intellectual" centre of Karnataka (which was
previously called _Mysore State_). But not content with this step-change, we
took a quick look at the place and then headed to our main destination
_Srirangapatna_, a small village nearby which contains some important historical
sites. The first was one of Tipu Sultan's palaces, which is an ornate teak
pavillion in the Indo-Islamic style, surrounded by green lawns and towering
giant Rain trees. Nice but more of a country house than anything superior
and regal. The second was the wonderful Ranganathaswamy temple, built in the
10th century. Entering it felt like going into a subterranean lair: low stone
ceilings, held up by intricately carved columns, which kept most of the light
and heat out. I'm not very keyed into how one prays at these temples but there
seems to be an awful lot of queuing!
