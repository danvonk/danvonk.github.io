<p>Varanasi is one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited cities and frankly
it shows in some less than ideal ways: the oldest parts of the city consist of
dense housing and narrow labyrinthine alleyways. Now that’s not a problem
necessarily, as Venice and many cities in Spain are also built in the same way.
However, Varanasi takes city life to a new level. The alleyways are also home to
local cows, which while holy, do tend to make a huge mess on the pavement and
hog up the streets, making it difficult to get to where you’re going. Other
animals are also present, wandering the streets, like goats. The animal
husbandry, combined with the open drainage channels down the streets, gives the
place a very “charming” medieval feel, but it’s not for the faint of heart.</p>

<p>Of course, rather than the city itself, the main attraction to Varanasi is the
Ganges river, which is considered the holiest of all rivers in the Hindu faith;
it originally being a river Goddess residing in heaven but was brought down
safely to Earth by Shiva. Due to this sacred origin, the river has purifying
qualities, which wash not merely the body but also the soul. It does this by
loosening the karmic bonds and removing accumulated impurity, which leaves the
person well-prepared for further spiritual progress. As such, going for a little
bath in the river is a highly popular activity in India and even I was told by
people on the way there that I must do it. I wasn’t really entertaining the
idea, but when I actually arrived on the river bank (the ghats) and saw the deep
brown tint of the water, even putting a foot in seemed mad. This doesn’t stop
Hindu pilgrims from doing it though, but perhaps they are more acclimated to the local
bacteria than I am.</p>

<p>The Ganges isn’t just important for a purified life–it’s also highly
significant at death. According to Hindu belief, dying near the Ganges and being
cremated on the banks grants the soul direct access to liberation (moksha), that
is ending the endless cycle of reincarnation (samsara). They do this cremation
on wooden pyres right on the banks, where the public can see the bodies burn out
in the open. The logs and a veil cover most of the body itself, but sometimes
one can see the feet and head stick out of the sides of the pyre, which is a fairly
gruesome sight. Once the body is cremated, they send the remains into the river,
completing the soul’s journey and ending the need for the soul to take another
body.</p>
