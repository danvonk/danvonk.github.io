<p>Already preceding my entry into Armenia, had I heard accusations and assertions
about this place. It was on the train journey to Kars, a town in Turkey, near
to the border with Armenia, had we been conversing with a Turkish man who, when
we told him we were going to Armenia, made sure to explain that we would
hear much about the Armenian genocide, but that it simply wasn‚Äôt true. After
all, the Ottoman Empire was a powerful entity, he stressed to us, surely if they
wanted to exterminate the Armenian people, they would have done so thoroughly
and without any half-measures?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In the typical English way, I did not demur at this obviously false and highly
inflammatory statement and instead let him continue his rant, though it did cause
me to realise the complicated nature of national and race relations in this part
of the world.</p>

Ruins of the old Armenian capital of Ani

<p>When we arrived in the border town of Kars, we found it to have a different
atmosphere than the other Turkish cities we visited and we started to get
glimpses of the Armenian culture. Scattered around the place, were remnants of
past Armenian and later, Russian architecture. These structures are distinctive,
built with basalt stone in a rounded-arch style, similar to what westerners
today consider as byzantine architecture. We then took a bus out to the ruins of
the old medieval city of <em>Ani</em>, a UNESCO heritage site. This once-city lays on
the austere plains of the <em>Armenian Highlands</em> , where it is protected on one
side by the dramatic canyon created by the <em>Arkhurian</em> river, shown in the image
above, and a valley on the other side. Once a bustling place, founded around the
5th century, it was a trading centre with the Byzantines, Arabs and the
Persians. It was home to cathedrals, churches of both the Armenian and Georgian
kind, mosques and public squares; all contained in imposing city walls. However,
already in the 11th century, it was sacked by the Seljuk Turks and in the
following centuries also the Mongols. Today just a few of its buildings survive,
standing amongst a whole lot of rubble. Instead the greatest present landmark
here is the skyscraper-sized Turkish flag erected just beside the site. Right on
the border, it proudly displays the extent of the Turkish landmass<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">We also saw

Armenia.</p>
<p>A few days later, we took the night-train to the capital <em>Yerevan</em> from Georgia.
This was quite a strange contrast to our experiences in Georgia. In that
country, due to the Russian invasion in 2008, they have tried to erase all
traces of Russian culture and history from their cities and towns. However, on
the train, we had just entered a little slice of Russia, as it was fully operated
by the Russian state railway company <em>RZD</em>. All of the signs were in Russian,
as was the toiletry kit and indeed when the border officers came into our cabin,
they didn‚Äôt greet us in Armenian but instead with <em>–ó–¥—Ä–∞–≤—Å—Ç–≤—É–π—Ç–µ</em>. It turns out
that Armenia has sold off their railways to the Russians and indeed border
checks are done by the Russian FSB!</p>

<p>When we arrived in Yerevan, I found it equally strange. The city centre, called
the <em>Kentron</em> district, is a creation of Stalin and it is actually very
beautiful! It is reminiscent of Paris, with its large tree-lined boulevards with
impressive buildings like opera houses, museums and academies sitting upon them,
all in the typical basalt stone of the region. The metro is very much a relic of
the old Soviet times, where you are still required to pay with plastic tokens to
pass through the ticket barriers. It is grand and full of marble, just as you
might expect but it is only a single line and has seen no expansion since it was
built. All the station names are in Cyrillic. One station we visited had
a mural on the ceiling showing a map of the territory of Armenia, naturally
including places like Kars, which haven‚Äôt been Armenian for over a hundred
years.</p>

<p>The city also has a large <em>victory park</em>, just as can be found in almost every
major city in the former Soviet Union. In this one, there is a 50m tall statue
of a woman holding a sword. She is the female personification of Armenia and she
replaces an equally huge statue of Josef Stalin that stood there until 1962. Not
just Soviet/Russian culture pervades this place, but also their troops. As we
took day trips out to places like Lake Sevan, we encountered their garrisons
beside the highway. They were always identifiable as they also hung a Russian
flag by the side of the road.</p>
<p>These Russian troops are the security guarantors of the country: as soon as
Armenia gained its independence in 1991, it started a war with neighbouring
Azerbaijan to recapture Ngorno-Karabach, a region in Azerbaijan consisting mainly
of Armenians and with a strong historical link to the country. This caused
Turkey and Azerbaijan to embargo the country, which still persists to this day.
As Azerbaijan‚Äôs military has become stronger, due mostly to the country‚Äôs vast
oil wealth, Armenia‚Äôs position has become precarious and has required Russia to
step in. This isolates it from their natural ally Georgia, whose recent history
causes it to distrust any Russian involvement. Armenia has become an isolated
country that feels stuck in the past and with little hope of resolving its
geopolitical issues, which is a shame as I found this country to be culturally
fascinating and naturally beautiful.</p>
