One of the highlights of the trip to Kyrgyzstan was taking the UAZ, the
go-anywhere vehicle, up into the remote fringes of the country. It was the type
of journey for which the van was designed and I was not disappointed! The
scenery encountered along the way remains some of the best I've ever seen and
being able to drive around essentially anywhere unrestricted or meeting
much sign of human life remains a priceless experience for me.

The aim of the journey was to see Kol'su lake, an alpine lake hidden
between the peaks of the central Tian Shan mountain range, which separate
Kyrgyzstan from China. The lake itself sits at an elevation of 3514 metres.
The lake itself has an air of mystical quality about it: Kol'su was formed by a
seismic event in the 1970s and has no proper outflow. Nevertheless water
manages to escape underground through cracks in the rock formations and through soil. This
causes it to occasionally dry out entirely, before it can be resupplied by the
Kurumduk river.

We set off from Bishkek and headed due south. It felt good to be out
of the capital, which was, as usual, an extremely polluted and chaotic place--not the
primary reason anyone has for visiting Kyrgyzstan. The further south we went, the
emptier the place became until it was more common for us to meet animals on the
road than other vehicles.

Kyrgyzstan that they have learnt to use the road, which surely makes for a much
smoother journey for them than overland.")

Eventually we ran out of road, which is more common than it might sound in
Kyrgyzstan. Really only the main highways and population centres are paved.
People instead make do with a nice gravel track most of the time and
that was certainly no problem for the UAZ, though the lack of any good
suspension made it less than comfortable for the passengers inside.

Sunset marked the end of the first day of driving as no sane person would drive
nocturnally here. The UAZ was configured in camper mode and we had an agreeable
meal of childrens' alphabet soup. The rest of the "victuals", especially those in
glass containers, had been completely obliterated due to the obscene levels of bumpiness along the way.

Still driving further south, the scenary went from beautiful to stunning as we
left the open country for the mountains.

otherwise monotonous green desert of the steppe near Bosogo.")

Driving on these dirt tracks in the UAZ requires a bit of skill. The roads are
universally terrible with deep corrugations and many potholes. Because the UAZ
has so little in the way of suspension, hitting a pothole means jumping up in
your seat and hitting your head on the roof, meanwhile the whole car squeaks and
groans. Therefore, the best strategy is to go as fast as you can in order to
glide over the corrugations while juking and weaving around the potholes.

horses didn't care one bit for the horn. Instead, weaving through the group is
the only option.")

formed by the run-off from the Tian Shan mountains and they become a popular
spot for the local wildlife.")

Towards the afternoon of the second day on the road, we crossed into the
controlled area along the chinese border (permit required) and that marked our
ascent into the Tian Shan mountains proper.

into view for the first time. Some cattle are likewise enjoying the view and
some refreshment from the mountain stream.")

The final stretch of road to Kel'su is flat and open, with the glistening, snow-capped mountains
towering taking centre-stage. This was the most memorable scene of the entire journey for
me and it far outstripped seeing the actual lake itself! A family call the feet
of this mountain range their home, with their yurts setup here. To see the lake,
the patriarch of the family took us on horseback up through the trail to see the
view. After this, we returned and had a nice dinner of local honey and jam (delicious) along with
some boiled yak (an acquired taste).
