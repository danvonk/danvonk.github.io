<p>Iâ€™ve long been putting off visiting Venice as it has a reputation of being one
of the most touristy places on Earth. Itâ€™s known as a place where the streets
are clogged with Chinese and American group tours and everything is absurdly
expensive to match. Then thereâ€™s the governmentâ€™s response to the
overtourismâ€“fleece the tourists even more. Nope, neither of those sound
particularly appealing. However, now that I live in Munich, itâ€™s pretty easy to
get a coach there and itâ€™s not only cheap, but traverses some of the most
beautiful countryside in Europe on the way there as it goes directly through the
Alps on the Brenner Pass. So clearly it was finally time to make the plunge and
visit.</p>

<p>I stayed in Mestre, which is an industrial port city on the land-side of Venice.
Its skyline is marked by the firm Fincantieri, who have their large marine
cranes towering over the place. This firm constructs the mega cruise-ships for
Norwegian Cruise Lines and the like. So the Venice isnâ€™t just an open-air
museum, at least for now! Another suprise was how international the employees
were as well, with many East Asians but also plenty of people from all over
Europe. This was only an advantage for me as Mestre had some great cheap
restaurants catering to them, which I frequented before and after commuting from
the Venice proper on the train.</p>
<p>But back to Venice: as soon as I stepped out of the train, I admitted to myself
that the tourists <em>are</em> on to something. The city is really a feast for the eyes
and unlike anywhere Iâ€™ve visited before. In fact, itâ€™s probably the most
beautiful city Iâ€™ve ever visited. No matter if the weather is gloomy or sunny,
there is something truly unique about wandering through the meandering alleys
that squirm between or even underneath those ornate and time-worn
buildingsâ€“sometimes with your path astride the turquoise coloured canals or
sometimes them leading you astray into residential cul-de-sacs so narrow that
you canâ€™t even open your umbrella.</p>

<p>Most of the signs in Venice lead to St.Â Markâ€™s Square and after some fruitful
accidental circumnavigation of the districts, so did I. This was another
magnificent location and I found the history of Veniceâ€™s maritime and democratic
history on display in the museums and palaces around the square captivating.
There was even some Empress Sisi intrigue (yuck).</p>
