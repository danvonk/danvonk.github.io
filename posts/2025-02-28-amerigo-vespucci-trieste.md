I was returning to Triest on the coach, when overhead a troupe of fighter jets
flew right over us, emanating smoke trails in the colours of the Italian flag
behind them. Needless to say this was quite a surprise! It was because there
turned out to be a major event occurring in Triest on that weekend: the return of
the Amerigo Vespucci to Italy after a two-year long tour around the world.

This is one of the vessels the Italian navy uses to train sailors but apart
from that I can't say much more about it, though it was very chic looking. In
port as well on that weekend was _Trieste_, which is the Italian navy's latest
and greatest amphibious assault ship or basically a mini aircraft carrier.

There were also military parades, including one by the cavalry regiment of the
Carabinieri, which were all good fun. I also spent some time walking around the
city and think it's quite underrated! Although it's in the back corner of the
country and definitely not comparable to Venice or Florence, I thought the city
was pleasently grandiose with a lot of heritage from the late 19th century ocean-liner
days and an interesting mix of Italian and Austrian architecture. On the weekend
it was buzzing with well-frequented cafés, bars and restaurants, which made it
feel much busier than its size would suggest.
