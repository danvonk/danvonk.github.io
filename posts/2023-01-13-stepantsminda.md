Georgia is a land of stunning geography but one of the highlights for me was our
tour starting in the capital and driving the _Military Highway_ through the
Caucuses mountains up to Gudauri, which is a ski resort town. This road is
steeped in the history of the region, having been used by invaders and merchants since at
least the first century BC.

It is a treacherous road that twists and turns as it climbs to about 2,100m. When
we visited in November, the beautiful sub-tropical weather of the capital bid us
farewell as we ventured into the mountains. The visibility became poor as 
we climbed altitude and light snow continued to fall, painting the alpine fields
white, a high contrast to the black tarmac, the only other visible thing for
certain periods of the drive. We were in a long wheel-base minibus, with racing-style bucket seats
(suprisingly popular in the region) and bright blue LED strip lights running
the length of the roof in the aisle. Our driver was keen and drove rapidly
through the twisting corners, often in the middle of the road, with the oncoming
traffic occluded by the horizon or mountain-side. In the case that he had to
compromise the road, he deftly manoeuvred us right to the precipice, so we had a
good view of the valley floor from our window. I don't usually
get any kind of motion sickness but for this journey, I strapped in as tight as
I could, held onto the handle bars and looked straight ahead.

These two photos are taken from a tourist stop along the highway, namely the
_Russian-Georgian Friendship Monument_, built in 1983 to celebrate the ongoing
friendship between the two soviet nations. Georgia has re-evaluated its
friendship with Russia after they invaded in 2008, so this is usually said with
air-quotes. Nevertheless, the view of the _Devil's Valley_ was stunning.
