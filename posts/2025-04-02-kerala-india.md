After having experienced the hustle and bustle of Bangalore, the next plan was
to explore Kerala, a state which is located on the tropical south-western tip of
the subcontinent. On its coast it is home to vast stretches of palm tree adorned
beaches, which are flanked by rice fields criss-crossed by small canals, just as
in Venice. Going further inland, one meets the mighty _Western Ghats_ mountain
range, a high-altitude rainforest, home to elephants and tigers, which is ideal for escaping the oppressive
humidity on the coast. Politically, it is also well-known within India for its
high degree of development--it has the highest literacy rates, life expectancy
and lowest impoverishment rates in the country. All great things. And they also
love a bit of communism too it turns out.

Yes, it was quite jarring to see the communists flags everywhere and when
travelling on a dusty road through the jungle, one might easily mistake the
place for Cuba. However, the topic of communism in Kerala is complex. Though
they never went for "true" communism, they did carry out extensive land reform
and institute a generous welfare state. This clearly did have some positive
outcomes: the place felt a lot more "civilised", less chaotic and far more
orderly than Karnataka. However, when speaking to locals, many of them weren't
that contented with the economic situation and indeed it was common for them
still toeleave for the more dynamic city of Bangalore (or even to work as labour
in the Gulf) while the economy of Kerala at home remains sluggish and highly
indebted.

communist flag along the roadside somewhere. The Communist Part of India (CPI)
have been in government coalitions for about half a century in Kerala.")

As a tourist, I'm not qualified to talk much more about the politics of the
place. Instead, for me, one of the main draws was the history of the state. It
is located on the _Malabar Coast_ of India and has been connected to the Silk
Road and Spice Trade since at least the first millennium BC, when Arab and
Phoenician traders would sail from the Red Sea and Persian Gulf to the coast to
trade for the spices. Later on, the Portuguese, Dutch and even French would setup base there
too and major cities such as Cochin and Calicut have interesting relics from this
early colonial past. No wonder too as the list of spices native to the area is impressive: black
pepper, cardamom, turmeric, cinnamon and ginger to name a few. Nowadays, there
are plantations in the mountainous uplands for tea, coffee and cocoa too.
If you visit, you'll surely make a tour of one of these places.

Indeed, escaping the coast and going into the mountains was my favourite part of
the trip. Whilst the tropical beaches look nice on photos, being there is
another story! It was 35c without fail every day (and not much cooler in the
evenings) with 100% humidity and frequent thunderstorms. Also, the backwaters
(the canals) provide the ideal conditions for mosquitoes so the place is just
teeming with them.
