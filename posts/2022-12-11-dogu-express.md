In November, amidst unseasonably warm weather in the south-east of old Blighty, I hopped on a plane to Ankara for a two-week adventure through Turkey and the near east with an old friend. It had been a trip many months in the pipeline--searching the internet for routes to travel, resolving conflicting reports between travel bloggers and attempting to buy tickets through dodgy untranslated websites, i.e. the usual.

Once we touched down in Ankara, the preconceived simulation of the trip that I had been imagining and living during the idle moments of the workday immediately disappeared. We were plonked down into a bustling city, the size of which I had not previously experienced. London can be a busy place if you go looking for it, around the train stations during rush hour, or if you are so unfortunate to walk from a quiet alleyway, hiding there since the middle ages, onto Oxford Street. But London is flat and it hides its size well; the sight-lines are managed and pedicured.

In Ankara, large, rocky hills dominate the skyline, they being almost entirely built up with concrete tenement buildings, stretching off into the horizon, the buildings are covered in soot and dirt, baked in by the hot sun. Down on the street level, the roads are traffic jammed with old clunkers and the pavements likewise chock-full and alive. People crowd around street vendors sitting behind picnic tables, which are stacked with lotto tickets, everyone hoping to win. Dogs and cats are found through the quieter alleyways, either commuting or relaxing in front of shop windows.

This freneticisism was exciting to be in for a couple of days, but thankfully the day soon came for us to board the Dogu Express. The train leaves Ankara Station in the evening daily, so
