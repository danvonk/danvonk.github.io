<p>The best part of a trip are always the unexpected turns and surprises. For
me, this manifested itself while I was walking down the street from New Delhi
railway station, hoping to get to my hotel. By chance, a fellow pedestrian
struck up a conversation with me as I was dodging through the
general chaos and detritus of the Delhi streetscape: autos, hawkers and strewn
rubbish piles; I’m sure you can imagine what it’s like. The fellow pedestrian
turned out to be an anglophile and very much into snooker. Particularly Ronny
Sullivan and definitely not at all that Chinese guy who’s ascendant. This made
for a humorous conversation, even though I know next to nothing about snooker.
However, as we talked futher about my plans for the trip, I showed him my onward
train ticket: it turned out that a simple mistake was about to change my whole
itinerary and send me to somewhere entirely unexpected!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The itinerary was all precisely laid out. I would stay in Delhi for a few days,
while making a day-trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal and possibly also out to
Rajasthan, the desert state home to many impressive forts and palaces–if
possible. After which, I would take a night train east to Banares, the holiest
of all Hindu cities, to see the Ganges. However, upon scrutiny by this friendly
pedestrian, the whole plan fell apart due to my misplaced trust in my railway
booking. I had bought my train ticket on a third-party website (12go.asia to be
exact) as one can only book directly through the Indian Railways website with an
Indian phone number. The ticket itself looked fine and official: it had my name
on it and the exact train I wanted to take. It even said “CNF” on it for
“confirmed”. However, little did I know that confirmed means next to nothing on
the Indian Railways! Confirmed status is only a placeholder until your allocated
bunk number appears on the ticket, which of course mine never did, and tickets
are usually sold out weeks before the train’s departure, so re-booking wasn’t an
option. The friendly pedestrian explained all of this and then brought me to a
hole-in-the-wall travel agent in an obscure street somewhere near Connaught
Place. I was dreading this, to be honest, as I knew this was a great opportunity
for someone to make some dough from a tourist with no other options. Although
this is exactly what happened, I’m not too sore about it as the resulting trip
was highly worthwhile and well-removed from anything I would have planned.</p>
<p>The travel agent was a cheerful and fairly rotund man, who clearly had been
doing this for a long time. He waxed poetically to me about his travels in
England, having been to Chester and surrounds only a few weeks ago. Likewise, he
showed me all of the tourism awards bestowed upon him by the high and mighty of
Indian society. After a short introduction, I explained to him my situation as
well as my general plans for the trip. Of course, he promptly ignored my plan to
spend a few days in Delhi and then go eastwards. Why should I spend time in
Delhi, he said. It’s a horrible and polluted city. Now this wasn’t exactly
untrue: while I was there, the AQI air quality index was hitting record levels
of pollution (over 400) and the air was smoggy and sulphurous, with a grey haze
hanging over the place. Instead, I should go to Kashmir, he opined. Of course,
the fact that he was Kashmiri and was planning to send me to an acquaintance’s
homestay was a pure coincidence, I’m sure. There was a bit of back and forth but
ultimately I relented to his suggestion on the condition that this diversion to
my travel plans only last a few days and that he book my onward train travel.
His colleague then asked for my Booking.com account, where I had already made
all of my hotel bookings for the trip. As I would now be delayed by 4 days,
these all had to be cancelled. This was no big deal he explained, as they were
experts in coming up with all sorts of excuses (medical etc.) to cancel bookings
without incurring fees. After coughing up payment, padded by a couple hundred
euros I’m sure, I found myself being led into a taxi, headed directly to the
airport for the next flight to Srinigar, departing in an hour and a half.</p>

</figure>
<p>The flight itself was only about 40 minutes and unremarkable excepting the
beautiful descent into the mountainous vale of Kashmir itself. I did have a
short chat with a woman behind me though, who thought it was insane for a person
to visit Kashmir solo, which I at first found funny, but led me to realise that
the exotic mysticism of the name Kashmir (in my head at least!), as exemplified
by the famous Led Zeppelin song, is overshadowed by the decades of conflict and
unrest in the minds of people here. This was very much confirmed as I stepped
out of the plane and onto the tarmac; the airport seemed more like a military
base than a civilian airport, with armed soldiers patrolling up and down and
huge Indian flags displayed proudly about the place just so we remembered that
we’re not in Pakistan.</p>

</figure>
<p>The initial experience of driving from the airport, through the streets of
Srinigar, to the homestay was jarring. It felt like a completely different
planet from Delhi, where I had been just a few hours earlier. The most striking
thing was to see the level of security virtually everywhere. There were groups
of (paramilitary) soldiers holding their rifles and standing around at virtually
every major intersection in the city, often manning checkpoints, as well as many
others on patrol through even quiet looking residential streets. Srinigar was
also not short on military apparatus: it’s very common to see machine-gun nests,
armoured personnel carriers and barbed-wire installations guarding the streets.
I also didn’t have any mobile phone signal for the duration of my stay as normal
Indian SIMs don’t work there for security reasons.</p>
<p>I later chatted with one of the soldiers, who explained to me that they are
almost never from Kashmir themselves, but rather sent from other, far-flung
places in India to serve on the frontlines in the mountains or to police the
citizenry in the valley. As such, the citizens of Kashmir sometimes feel
alienated and under occupation by their presence, given their different cultural and usually religious
backgrounds plus the isolated nature of the Kashmiri people, being closed in on
all sides by the high mountains of the western Himalayas. It also seemed that a
lot of the security presence in the valley was rather for anti-insurgency
purposes than protecting the people from any kind of Pakistani threat.</p>

</figure>
<p>Nevertheless, the military seemed professional and somewhat reassuring from a
tourist perspective. The Kashmiri police on the other hand looked a fair bit
more menacing! They seemed usually to dress entirely in black with a
bullet-proof vest and wield an AK-47. As they are recruited from the local
Kashmiri population, some have a beard or wear Pashtun hats or headscarves,
which, for better or worse, has a slight connotation from a Western perspective.</p>

<p>As for the town itself, I visited Kashmir in late Autumn and as such the weather
was hazy in the valley, which meant I didn’t get the fantastic views of the
mountains from Srinigar. It’s especially popular to take a boat/gondola (<em>shikara</em>) on
the lake and view the mountains from the water, which imposingly rise to ~3800m
on all sides. Nevertheless, I still found the lake interesting as the outer
parts of it still felt charmingly rural, with farmers growing lotus flowers in
their floating paddocks and kingfishers perched on the boundary fences, waiting
and watching. Srinigar also has an old town, where narrow lanes intersect
rows of historical timber-framed homes and shops, where one can buy the
essentials like a samovar and copper cups. I also visited Khanqah-e-Moula, the
oldest mosque in Srinigar, which is an intricately carved wooden building
decorated in papier mache. This was very heavily policed by both security forces
and Kashmiri police so I didn’t manage to take any photos.</p>

<p>For me, the main attraction to Kashmir is its natural beauty, so I made sure to
get out into the mountains ASAP. The most popular destination coming out of the
city is Sonamarg, a hill-station set in a high valley with alpine meadows and
surrounded by high peaks and glaciers. However, due to recent militant attacks,
I was told that one is only permitted by the military to stay up there for a
couple of hours, which makes the drive from Srinigar not so worthwhile. Of
course, it’s hard to say whether this is actually true or whether my driver just
didn’t feel like the trip on that day.</p>

<p>So instead, my driver dropped me off in a lower valley and I was guided
by a schoolboy (and entrepreneur with Tripadvisor and Facebook page!) along the
brook and up into the mountains. The scenery was definitely a nice change from
Srinigar as the sky was clear and much fresher than the polluted, hazy air in
the city.</p>

<p>Amusingly, my guided tour of the mountain valley turned into a bit of a
side-quest as another local village boy came and joined us. He said that he
needed to go up into the valley to look for a missing pony, who had gone off on
his own adventure, so my day was now imbued with an important mission!</p>

</figure>
<p>We did end up finding the pony after a few hours. It had decided to hang out
beside the mountain stream at the bottom of a steep cliff-face and therefore his
extraction was a bit tricky, but the village kids seemed quite adept at this
sort of thing. On the way back, I felt a bit sorry for the horse at times, as they did like to
whip it with twigs they found on the floor–although it was a very obstinate
creature and ran off multiple times before being caught again, I do admit.</p>

</figure>
<p>The day after the hike, it was time to resume my original plan to see India, but
instead of flying out of Kashmir, I took the opportunity to try out one of
India’s new highish-speed trains, the <em>Vande Bharat Express</em>, which now connects
Srinigar and Jammu, the other main city in the territory, which lies outside of
the vale in the Hindu majority lands bordering Pakistan. Although even this new
train would be considered a bit tatty and old-fashioned in Europe, the actual
track was very impressive as it traversed over deep Himalayan valleys using high
railway bridges (one of which is currently the highest in the world) and
likewise tunnelled directly through the mountains without diversion.</p>
<p>The security here was also very tight. Every carriage seemed to have a soldier
in uniform waiting by the doors and they would patrol through the gangway now
and then. Whenever we passed a station without stopping or entered one of the
long tunnels, one saw rifle-wielding police officers standing by the tracks, looking into the
train, presumably to check for hijackers.</p>

</figure>
<p>Once I arrived in Jammu, I had dinner with some local university students, who I
had met on the way and then headed to the railway station, where I was finally
able to experience my first night-train on the Indian Railways. I took the
<em>Jhelum Express</em> bound for Pune, though I only rode it for ~14 hours to Agra.
Despite its somewhat bad reputation in the West, I was in 3rd class (AC) and
found it quite comfortable and had interesting conversations with some fellow travellers,
including a soldier from Kerala, a Jain and a Punjabi, who were all curious
about my itinerary and I also learnt a lot about India reciprocally from them.
In fact, I found 2nd class (AC) to be far more boring, as the people were more
well-to-do and mostly kept to themselves and the added comfort was hardly worth it.</p>
