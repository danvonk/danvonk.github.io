You are cruising the pacific coast of California in your Mustang, the wind flows through
your hair and the engine purrs as you thread the car through the gentle turns along the
coastal highway. What could be better? How about trundling along in a UAZ!

During my holiday to the central Asian countries of Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan,
we rented a UAZ-452 from a guy named Vlad in Bishkek. The UAZ is the natural
choice for this region. It is the kind of place that requires a go-anywhere vehicle.
Just that, the UAZ-452 is a four-wheel drive cab-over^[meaning the
front passengers sit on top of the engine.] van that has been mass-produced since
1965, originally in the Soviet Union, but now Russia. It has a distinctive
snub-nosed shape which has led it to be nick-named the _bukhanka_ or (bread)
loaf and is as legendary there as the VW bus is in the west. It remains one of the most popular models of vehicle on the roads of central
Asia, where it is famed for its rugged construction...and also terrible
reliability.

But perhaps reliability is overrated if it is nice to drive? So _what_ is the UAZ
like to drive? Well it definitely has some vintage features. Firstly and often 
skipped by car reviewers, is actually unlocking the vehicle. In the
case of the UAZ, it has a main key for the ignition
as well as a secondary key (similar in appearance to one you might
use to open a mailbox) to open the doors and definitely no central locking. So
expect a lot of pacing around the van, making sure that all the doors are
locked or unlocked. 

Once you have jumped up and into the van
(there are no handles), you will be greeted by a spartan interior: a rubberised,
wobbly steering wheel and a likewise wobbly gearstick for the driver. There is also
no centre console, instead there's just a bulging carpeted mound, under which
the engine is located. On the
mound are two stacked levers which are used to engage the four-wheel drive and
low-range. Of course, they frequently jam and require a bit of first-gear
clutch action to get them unstuck. Naturally all UAZ drivers know the routine. The dashboard has a eight-segment LCD display to show the time and
fuel level of the two tanks ^[The tanks are connected, so that one does not have
to consciously switch fuel sources. However, they must still be filled up
separately, leading to annoying manoeuvres at petrol stations as the filling
points are on opposing sides of the van.] but no outdoor temperature, as the UAZ
can handle any climate. But if it should get cold, engaging the heater is
as simple as pulling up a flap over the exposed pipe-work extruding from the
dashboard.

Now that you have started the van and are off and driving, you will notice that
the engine doesn't do all that much. Although it has a relatively large
displacement petrol engine at 2.5 litres, it has as much horsepower as a city car.
However, this didn't really concern us as we were mostly travelling on some pretty
awful dirt tracks in the steppe. Here we could only do 20-40 km/h, and
the speed inside that range was dictated by how much we felt the van was going
to fall apart, as it sank into the deep potholes and corrugations on those
remote roads. Our model of UAZ was an ex-ambulance version (the UAZ-452A), which
I believe has even worse suspension than the normal ones. This I can definitely
believe as the van would shake, creak and squeak over essentially every
imperfection in the road. Meanwhile, Toyota Land-Cruisers and even clapped out
20 year-old VW Passats would rocket by and overtake us!

Driving on the blacktop was definitely more comfortable and the van had a bit of a
land-yacht feel to it. There was an extreme amount of play in the steering wheel
and similarly when the car was in gear, the gear-stick had more wobble than a typical
gearbox would have in neutral. This was compounded by the fact that 5th gear was
hilariously far away from the driver and you would have to lurch over to the
middle of the dashboard to reach it, hopefully not swerving to the side of the
road while you did it. As for the fuel economy, it wasn't bad at 14L/100km and we
even managed to run it on 72 octane fuel that we picked up in water bottles from
remote villages.

Overall, the UAZ is a unique but terrible vehicle and if you buy one in the
West, you should feel ashamed of yourself! However, in the context of
Kyrgyzstan, I can confidently say there is no vehicle I would rather have chosen
for this trip.
