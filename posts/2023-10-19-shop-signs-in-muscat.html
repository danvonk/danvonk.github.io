<p>Mustcat, Oman, is a busy city of about one and a half million people. In districts like
Al-Gubrah, it has wide, traffic-jammed boulevards lined with tall concrete
buildings. There often isnâ€™t any pavement but instead the side of the road is a
car park for the shops on the ground floor. The sun was scorching when I
visited in October and the temperature around 39c. Therefore, I wanted to stay
in the shade as much as possible and that meant keeping close to the shop
fronts. However, the more I walked around, the more amusing I found the names of
the shops!</p>

<p>In Oman, it seems there is a template for shop signage. It has the shopâ€™s brand name in
Arabic in the middle, followed by an English translation below. On the top-left
corner, is the registered company name in English and likewise in the right
corner, its name in Arabic. But what piqued my interest were the incredibly
literal names of the shops. Not only did the shops tend to be very specialised, but
they also didnâ€™t bother with any kind of branding like you see here in the West.
Instead, it does what it says on the tin!</p>

<p>I suppose this is because the lack of large supermarkets here<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">There were large
supermarket chains, such as Carrefour, but they seemed to be on the edge of town
and usually catered to the premium segment.<br />
<br />
</span></span> and affordable rent prices allows
such shops to exist but it also seemed nice that people can drive or walk around
their neighbourhood and shop at places more integrated into the local community.</p>

<p>Most places also accepted cards so it was already more convenient and in some ways more than
Germany.</p>
