<p>Over Christmas, I was browsing eBay for mandolins and came across this beauty
and my better senses did not prevailâ€“so I bought it for â‚¬45. Itâ€™s a flat-top mandolin
that was made in Leningrad in the mid 1980s.</p>

The label of the mandolin shows that it is the 316r model. Unfortunately the timestamp isn't completely legible but it seems to read 21st October 198x.

<p>Despite being around 40 years old, I donâ€™t reckon this instrument had ever been
played. The strings were so far off the fretboard they mightâ€™ve well been in
outer space! This of course made the instrument completely unplayable. In order
to fix this, I sanded down the floating bridge significantly, which was easy
enough as it has a flat bottom. However, this didnâ€™t help the fret height on
the low frets, so I needed to score out the routing for the strings over the
nutâ€“which I of course overdid, butchered it and then needed to fill and try
again! Then it was time to sand off the decades of corrosion left on the frets
and it was as good as new.</p>
<p>I also needed to find the correct position for the floating
bridge along the strings, as its original position had terrible intonation. This
is pretty easy to do with a tuner app or by ear. Now that this is all done, Iâ€™ve
been learning some irish jigs and rags on it and can report that itâ€™s not a bad instrument by any
means; it is also surprisingly loud and not even that tinny!</p>
