<p>After a year‚Äôs hiatus from playing electric guitar (I usually play fingerstyle
pieces on my acoustic nowadays), I had rediscovered my baby blue Tanglewood
Stratocaster, which was my first guitar. I had already modded it to the stage
where not much of the original guitar remained. The bridge was replaced by a MiM
Fender one, the tuners are now retro-style Washburn tuners, and similarly the pickups have
also been long since replaced by some nice ‚ÄúWarman‚Äù pickups made by a bloke in Wales.</p>

<p>The two most critical remaining pieces are of course the neck and the body. I
quite like the maple neck on this guitar and have no reason to replace it,
however, the body is cheap, light balsa-wood, finished with a thick,
plastic-feeling paint job. Also the colour is just terrible!</p>
<p>So I hatched my plan: after spending too long on YouTube, getting jealous at new Fender Strats, I decided to finally cure my
blues by more modding. Specifically, after a bit of surfing eBay, I bought a
replacement body for my Partscaster for ‚Ç¨180. It is a two-piece alder body and
has this fantastic wine-burst finish, which as far as I know, was available for
a short run from Fender in the mid 90s, but nothing outside of the custom shop since.</p>

<p>It was a fairly simple operation to swap out the body, though there were some
niggles. Firstly, the neck didn‚Äôt exactly fit into the body, so the neck carving
needed a bit of sanding to make for a snug fit for the neck. The other annoyance
was that the screw holes on the body weren‚Äôt exactly straight (and neither was
the neck), this meant that the neck is two or so degrees off-centre, also
requiring that the bridge be also slightly off kilter, which is visible in the
first picture.</p>
<p>If I had received such a guitar from the Fender factory, I would be quite
annoyed, but having a slightly wonky bridge is fine on this mash-up guitar, it
might even give me it some sentimental value‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Overall, the guitar still plays great and I don‚Äôt notice the off-centre bridge
when the strings are on it anyway. I am quite pleased with this latest mod and
would encourage anyone else to have a go as well, if they have any knock-off
strats lying around.</p>
