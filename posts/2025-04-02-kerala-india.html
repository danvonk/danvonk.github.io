<p>After having experienced the hustle and bustle of Bangalore, the next plan was
to explore Kerala, a state which is located on the tropical south-western tip of
the subcontinent. On its coast it is home to vast stretches of palm tree adorned
beaches, which are flanked by rice fields criss-crossed by small canals, just as
in Venice. Going further inland, one meets the mighty <em>Western Ghats</em> mountain
range, a high-altitude rainforest, home to elephants and tigers, which is ideal
for escaping the oppressive humidity on the coast. Politically, it is also
well-known within India for its high degree of development‚Äìit has the highest
literacy rates, life expectancy and lowest impoverishment rates in the country.
All great things. And they also love a bit of communism too it turns out.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yes, it was quite jarring to see the communists flags everywhere and when
travelling on a dusty road through the jungle, one might easily mistake the
place for Cuba. However, the topic of communism in Kerala is complex. Though
they never went for ‚Äútrue‚Äù communism, they did carry out extensive land reform
and institute a generous welfare state. This clearly did have some positive
outcomes: the place felt a lot more ‚Äúcivilised‚Äù, less chaotic and far more
orderly than Karnataka. However, when speaking to locals, many of them weren‚Äôt
that contented with the economic situation and indeed it was common for them
still toeleave for the more dynamic city of Bangalore (or even to work as labour
in the Gulf) while the economy of Kerala at home remains sluggish and highly
indebted.</p>

Wherever you go in Kerala, you'll see a communist flag along the roadside somewhere. The Communist Part of India (CPI) have been in government coalitions for about half a century in Kerala.

<p>As a tourist, I‚Äôm not qualified to talk much more about the politics of the
place. Instead, for me, one of the main draws was the history of the state. It
is located on the <em>Malabar Coast</em> of India and has been connected to the Silk
Road and Spice Trade since at least the first millennium BC, when Arab and
Phoenician traders would sail from the Red Sea and Persian Gulf to the coast to
trade for the spices. Later on, the Portuguese, Dutch and even French would
setup base there too and major cities such as Cochin and Calicut have
interesting relics from this early colonial past. No wonder too as the list of
spices native to the area is impressive: black pepper, cardamom, turmeric,
cinnamon and ginger to name a few. Nowadays, there are plantations in the
mountainous uplands for tea, coffee and cocoa too. If you visit, you‚Äôll surely
make a tour of one of these places.</p>

The beaches of Alleppey, Kerala are wide and still used as working beaches by fishermen.

<p>Indeed, escaping the coast and going into the mountains was my favourite part of
the trip. Whilst the tropical beaches look nice on photos, being there also has
its downsides! It was 35c without fail every day (and not much cooler in the
evenings) with 100% humidity and frequent thunderstorms. Also, the backwaters
(the canals) provide the ideal conditions for mosquitoes so the place is just
teeming with them.</p>
<p>The closest major hill station reachable from Kochi is Munnar. It‚Äôs easily and
cheaply accessible by coach from Ernakulum bus station, though getting a
comfortable ride is far from guaranteed! Expect a packed bus with no ventilation
other than the open windows.</p>
<p>Munnar itself is touristy and you‚Äôll be swamped by auto drivers trying to sell
you voyages around the tea fields as you walk through the town. However, it‚Äôs
still worth doing all of this least as you get a very scenic ride through the
rainforests and tea fields. Our driver also took us to a well-known spot for
seeing elephants and we just found them hanging out by a creek, cooling
themselves off!</p>

<p>Sunrise hikes are another popular tourist activity here and it‚Äôs another
money-maker for the local town: one can‚Äôt just enter the national park by
themselves, one needs a guide. So with our guide, we set off at 5AM to
<em>Eravikulam National Park</em> to climb the second highest mountain in the Ghats. It
wasn‚Äôt a particularly challenging climb as the mountain was only about 2000m
high and some locals were even doing it in crocs. Nevertheless, it was worth the
early wake-up as the views were spectacular and it was a far-cry from the
mountain views at home.</p>
