<p>After having experienced the hustle and bustle of Bangalore, the next plan was
to explore Kerala, a state which is located on the tropical south-western tip of
the subcontinent. On its coast, it is home to vast stretches of palm tree
adorned beaches, which are flanked by rice fields criss-crossed by small canals,
just as in Venice–though maybe a bit less flamboyant. Going further inland, one
meets the mighty <em>Western Ghats</em> mountain range, a high-altitude rainforest,
home to elephants and tigers, which is ideal for escaping the oppressive
humidity on the coast. Politically, it is also well-known within India for its
high degree of development: it has the highest literacy rates, life expectancy
and lowest impoverishment rates in the country. All great things. And they also
love a bit of communism too it turns out.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yes, it was quite jarring to see the communists flags everywhere and when
travelling on a dusty road through the jungle, one might easily mistake the
place for Cuba. However, the topic of communism in Kerala is complex. Though
they never went for “true” Communism, they did carry out extensive land reform
and institute a generous welfare state. This clearly did have some positive
outcomes: the place felt a lot more “civilised”, less chaotic and far more
orderly than Karnataka. However, when speaking to locals, many of them weren’t
that contented with the economic situation and indeed it was common for them
still to leave for the more dynamic city of Bangalore (or even to work as labour
in the Gulf) while the economy at home remains sluggish and highly
indebted.</p>

<p>As a tourist, I’m not qualified to talk much more about the politics of the
place. Instead, for me, one of the main draws was the history of the state. It
is located on the <em>Malabar Coast</em> of India and has been connected to the Silk
Road and Spice Trade since at least the first millennium BC, when Arab and
Phoenician traders would sail from the Red Sea and Persian Gulf to the coast to
trade for spices. Later on, the Portuguese, Dutch and even French would
setup base there too and the major cities, such as Cochin and Calicut, have
interesting relics from this early colonial past. No wonder too as the list of
spices grown in the area is impressive: black pepper, cardamom, turmeric, mangosteen,
cinnamon and ginger to name a few. Nowadays, there are plantations in the
mountainous uplands for tea, coffee and cocoa too. If you visit, you’ll surely
make a tour of one of these places.</p>
<p>The coastal towns of Cochin and Alleppey seemed primarily to be tourist
destinations, whereas most locals and businesses were a bit further inland, in
Ernakulum, which serves as the main transport hub of the region. Nevertheless,
the towns did have a certain charm, with the tropical paradise feeling certainly
helping. Alleppey was more of a beach town with hippie hostels and beach cafes
but this suited me just fine towards the end of the trip.</p>

<p>The Kerala backwaters are another great day-trip to make and we did ours in long
piloted canoes. I’d recommend this over the traditional house boats, which double up
as hotels. Those boats are quite large and don’t get you into the smaller
waterways, which feel much more authentic and local.</p>

<p>However, escaping the coast and going into the mountains was my favourite part
of the trip around Kerala. Whilst the tropical beaches look nice on photos,
being there also has its downsides! It was at least 35C without fail every day (and not
much cooler in the evenings) with 100% humidity and frequent thunderstorms.
Also, the backwaters (the canals) provide the ideal conditions for mosquitoes so
the place is just teeming with them.</p>
<p>The closest major hill station reachable from Cochin is Munnar. It’s easily and
cheaply (less than 100 rupees) accessible by coach from Ernakulum bus station,
though getting a comfortable ride is far from guaranteed! Expect a packed bus
with no AC: the ventilation is provided by the lack of (glass) windows, so hope
you don’t get stuck in traffic. The trip itself though is stunning, with the
winding roads taking you up through the jungle (watch out for the monkeys) and
finally into the emerald-green
tea hills above, interspersed with the occasional blooming jacaranda tree nobly
perched between.</p>
<p>Munnar itself is quite touristy and you’ll be swamped by auto drivers trying to sell
you voyages around the tea fields as you walk through town. Annoying. However, it’s
still worth doing the tour at least once as you get a very scenic ride through the
jungle and tea fields. Our driver also took us to a well-known spot for
seeing elephants and we just found them hanging out by a creek, cooling
themselves off! (NB: I think they are there a lot.)</p>

<p>Sunrise hikes are another popular tourist activity here and it’s another
money-maker for the local town: one can’t just enter the national park by
himself, one needs a guide. So with our guide, we set off at 5 AM to
<em>Eravikulam National Park</em> to climb the second highest mountain in the Ghats. It
wasn’t a particularly challenging climb as the mountain was only about 2000m
high and some locals were even doing it in crocs! Nevertheless, it was worth the
early wake-up as the views were simply spectacular. It was still shortly before dawn as we
reached the peak and we were surrounded by dark and ominous cloud cover in every
direction, but as the sun started to rise, it painted the clouds amber beneath us as if the whole world was
ablaze. Before long, the power of the sun started to disperse the clouds
and we watched them melt down into the valleys, forming long, wispy trails of
fog. A pale blue sky formed and we were again able to see the
verdant tea fields clinging on to the side of the hills below our feet. A fantastic way
to start the day.</p>
