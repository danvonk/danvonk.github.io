<p>After a long winter and a damp spring, by April, it was finally time for a
holiday and the chosen venue this time was Morocco. For me, there is a particular
allure to leaving Europe and vacationing in a new continent and I have barely
scratched the surface of Africa so far in my life. Furthermore, the decision to travel to
Morocco was further spurred on by the fact that Ryanair flew to several
destinations in the country for less than $40, which is certainly a price that
can’t be argued with! Amongst those options, my friend and I chose to fly to
Essaouira, a small fishing town on the Atlantic coast, about midway down the
length of the country.</p>
<p>I found the town charming and in retrospect, a perfect introduction to the
country. It had a small but pretty <em>casbah</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Casbahs also exist in other
countries such as Algeria.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, which are the historic centres of Moroccan towns,
separated by castle walls, which often have battlements and towers which used to protect
against invaders. In our time of mass-tourism, these places are usually full of
street vendors trying to flog their trinkets and other traditional, though
surely made in China, souvenirs. Essaouria was no exception but we later found
the larger city of Marrakech to be so much worse.</p>

<p>One delight of the town were the numerous small restaurants in the centre. I
found moroccan-style breakfast, usually shakshouka and cafe au lait<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I can’t

<br />
</span></span> to be delicious. Waking up and eating under
the stark blue sky was a nice change from the drab, dull colours of northern
Europe at this time of year as well. Upon leaving the casbah, one would become
acquainted with a more realistic vision of ordinary life in the country. One of
heaving street markets, with vendors selling freshly-caught seafood, fruit and
spices. The streets were dusty and chaotic with backed-up cars blaring their horns while
scooters weaved through the traffic. All in all, I think this is a pretty
standard picture for most markets in industrialising countries but I
nevertheless dearly enjoy the energy of these places.</p>
<p>As evening fell, we had our first dinner in Morocco. This consisted of <em>harira</em>,
which is a traditional soup made from
tomato, lentils and chickpeas with a tangy, citrus flavour to it. As a second
course we had <em>tagine</em>. In fact, over the course of the holiday we would eat a lot
of tagine; which I did enjoy every time, though I will admit that I would have
liked a little more variety towards the end of the holiday.</p>

<p>Apart from surfing, which we tried one day, there is not so much to keep you in this
town for long. Therefore, we continued our journey east and took a bus to Marrakech,
which is only about three hours by road. In my opinion, as a dumb tourist,
Marrakech is a truly awful place. It is obscenely busy everywhere and the
winding streets of the casbah make you feel like a mouse walking into a snake’s
lair, with everyone there trying to sell you stuff. Of course, they know exactly
who is a tourist from one quick glance and immediately they will pounce by being
faux friendly, forcing their objects into your hand and guilt-tripping you for
refusing to buy anything. If you withstand this, luckily the narrow alleyways of
the bazaar all empty out onto a large main square. Here you can find the
snake-charmers and dancing monkeys if that’s your thing.</p>
<p>I did enjoy taking the city bus around the city which felt authentic. In fact,
taking the local public transport is something I try to do whenever I visit a
new city because I get a feel for what it’s like to live in the city, not just
visit it. Marrakech also has some beautiful sights such as the <em>jardin secret</em>
with intricate mosaic tilings, which are seen all over the Islamic world, in
places such as Seville, but never fail to disappoint me.</p>
<p>One of my primary motivations for the trip was to see the Sahara desert.
Therefore, after a day in Marrakech, we headed east on a trip to the far eastern
corner of Morocco, a town called Merzouga. Although this isn’t technically yet
the Sahara, which lies still further east, to a lay-person, it was convincing
enough. The closer we got, the more martian the landscape appeared, with nothing
but flat rocky terrain and telegraph poles in sight. Every now and then, you
would see a makeshift shop selling fossils, though this seemed to be something
the previous generation was more interested in, as these places were almost always
deserted. Moreover, these ads for these places were usually in French, which is
nowadays second-place to English as the language for tourism in Morocco.</p>
<p>After many hours of driving, I was beginning to lose hope that I would see the
majestic sand dunes that you see in movies like <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em>. However,
it was only when we came in spitting distance of Merzouga, did the huge dunes
begin to impose themselves on the horizon. It was truly a bizarre sight–we had
been driving through miles of glass-flat terrain and then suddenly these
enormous, organic and undulating shaped monoliths begin to tower over the horizon.</p>

<p>In Morocco, the tourist track is very well-tended, so we got out of the van and immediately
met our Berber contact, who introduced us to our camels and we rode off into the
sand-dunes to stay the night in his desert camp.</p>
