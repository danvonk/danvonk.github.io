After a long winter and a damp spring, by April, it was finally time for a
holiday and the chosen venue this time was Morocco. For me, there is a particular
allure to leaving Europe and vacationing in a new continent and I have barely
scratched the surface of Africa so far in my life. The decision to travel to
Morocco was further spurred on by the fact that Ryanair flew to several
destinations in the country for less than $40, which is certainly a price that
can't be argued with! Amongst the those options, my friend and I chose to fly to
Essaouira, a small fishing town on the Atlantic coast, about midway down the
length of the country.

I found the town charming and in retrospect, a perfect introduction to the
country. It had a small but pretty _casbah_^[Casbahs also exist in other
countries such as Algeria.],  which are the historic centres of Moroccan towns,
separated by castle walls, which often have battlements and towers to protect
against invaders. In our time of mass-tourism, these places are usually full of
street vendors trying to flog their trinkets and other traditional, though
surely made in China, souvenirs. Essaouria was no exception but we later found
the larger cities such as Marakech to be far worse.
