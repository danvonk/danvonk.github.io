Cruising the pacific coast of California in your Mustang. The wind flows through
your hair and the engine purrs as you thread the car through the gentle turns along the
corniche. What could be better? How about a UAZ!

some laundry.")

During my holiday to the central Asian countries of Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan,
we rented a UAZ-452 from a guy named Vlad in Bishkek. The UAZ is the natural
choice for this region--after all--this is the place for a go-anywhere vehicle!
Just that, the UAZ-452 is a four-wheel drive cab-over^[The
front passengers sit on top of the engine.] van that has been produced since
1965, originally in the Soviet Union, now Russia. It has a distinctive
snub-nosed shape which has led it to be nick-named the _bukhanka_ or (bread)
loaf and is as legendary as the VW bus is in the west. Still one of the most popular models of vehicle on the roads of central
Asia, the UAZ is famed for its rugged construction...and also terrible
reliability.

But perhaps reliability is overrated if it is nice to drive? So what is the UAZ
like to drive? Well it definitely has some vintage features. Firstly and often 
skipped by car reviewers, is actually entering the vehicle. In the
case of the UAZ, this is quite humorous, as it has a main key for the ignition
as well as a secondary key similar in appearance to the one you might
use to open a mailbox, which opens the doors.




- rubberised steering wheel has a lot of play in the middle and it gets sticky!
- the gear shifter is floor mounted like a truck and has as much play in-gear as
  a normal car has in neutral
- the 5th gear was so far from the driver, you would swerve the wheel if you
  weren't careful
- we managed to get up to about 100km/h and do approx 14l/100km
- although a relatively big engine (2.5l), it has as much power as a city car
- the interior is spartan. We had an ex-ambulance model so we had some interior
  padding, else it would have been bare sheet metal
- No central locking. One key for the ignition and another mailbox-like one for
  opening the doors
- 4WD and low range could be engaged using two levers in the centre console.
  However, they would inevitably become stuck and needed some 1st gear massaging
  for them to come unstuck.
- The van has two fuel tanks. And they must be filled separately on either side
  of the van.
- Was great fun to drive
