Cruising the pacific coast of California in your Mustang. The wind flows through
your hair. The engine purrs as you thread the car through the turns along the
corniche. What could be better? How about a UAZ!

some laundry.")

During my holiday to the central Asian countries of Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan,
we rented a UAZ-452, the natural choice for this region. The UAZ-452 is a
four-wheel drive cab-over^[The front passengers sit on top of the engine.] van
that has been produced since 1965, originally in the Soviet
Union, now Russia. It has a distinctive snub-nosed shape which has led it to be
nick-named the _bukhanka_ or (bread) loaf.
