After a long winter and a damp spring, by April, it was finally time for a
holiday and the chosen venue this time was Morocco. For me, there is a particular
allure to leaving Europe and vacationing in a new continent and I have barely
scratched the surface of Africa so far in my life. I also had a romantic notion
of spending the night in the Sahara Desert. Furthermore, the decision to travel to
Morocco was further spurred on by the fact that Ryanair flew to several
destinations in the country for less than $40, which is certainly a price that
can't be argued with! Amongst the those options, my friend and I chose to fly to
Essaouira, a small fishing town on the Atlantic coast, about midway down the
length of the country.

I found the town charming and in retrospect, a perfect introduction to the
country. It had a small but pretty _casbah_^[Casbahs also exist in other
countries such as Algeria.],  which are the historic centres of Moroccan towns,
separated by castle walls, which often have battlements and towers to protect
against invaders. In our time of mass-tourism, these places are usually full of
street vendors trying to flog their trinkets and other traditional, though
surely made in China, souvenirs. Essaouria was no exception but we later found
the larger cities such as Marakech to be far worse.

of Essaouira extends right out to the rocky beach. The harbour is behind us and
the seagulls are awaiting the return of the fishing boats.")

One delight of the town were the numerous small restaurants in the centre. I
found moroccon-style breakfast, usually shakshouka and cafe au lait^[I can't
vouch for the authenticity though!] to be delicious. Waking up and eating under
the stark blue sky was a nice change from the drab, dull colours of northern
Europe at this time of year as well. As evening fell, we had our first dinner in
Morocco. This consisted of _harira_, which is a traiditional soup made from
tomato, lentils and chickpeas with a tangy, citrus flavour to it. As a second
course we had _tagine_. In fact, over the course of the holiday we would eat a lot
of tagine; which I did enjoy every time, though I will admit that I would have
liked a little more variety towards the end of the holiday.

Atlas mountains faintly visible in the background. Down below the streets are
narrow, labyrinthine and stink but are nevertheless welcome respite from the hot sun.")
