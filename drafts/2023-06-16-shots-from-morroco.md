After a long winter and a damp spring, by April, it was finally time for a
holiday. The chosen venue this time was Morocco. This was because Ryanair flew
to several destinations in the country for less than $40 and that's a price that
can't be argued with! Amongst the several options, we chose to flow to
Essaouira, which is a small coastal town, on the Atlantic towards the south of
the country.

It also has a somewhat exotic charm, which I always look for in a holiday. Kevin
Kelly calls this looking for the 'otherness', dissolving it through learning and then coming
back home a more holistic person.


Essaouira is primarily known as a small fishing town with a cute _casbah_ and good
enough waves for a beginner to cut their teeth on surfing.

After the small-time tourism of Essaouira, we headed over to Marrakech. This is
a busy and hectic place
