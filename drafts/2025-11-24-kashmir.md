The best part of a trip are always the unexpected turns and surprises. For
me, this manifested itself while I was walking down the street from New Delhi
railway station, hoping to get to my hotel. By chance, a fellow pedestrian
struck up a conversation with me as I was dodging and weaving through the
general chaos and detritus of the Delhi streetscape: autos, hawkers and strewn
rubbish piles; I'm sure you can imagine what it's like. The fellow pedestrian
turned out to be an anglophile and very much into snooker. Particularly Ronny
Sullivan and definitely not at all that Chinese guy who's ascendant. This made
for a humorous conversation, even though I know next to nothing about snooker.
However, as we talked futher about my plans for the trip, I showed him my onward
train ticket: it turned out that a simple mistake was about to change my whole
itinerary and send me to somewhere entirely unexpected!

The itinerary was all precisely laid out. I would stay in Delhi for a few days,
while making a day-trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal and possibly also out to
Rajasthan, the desert state home to many impressive forts and palaces--if
possible. After which, I would take a night train east to Banares, the holiest
of all Hindu cities, to see the Ganges. However, upon scrutiny by this friendly
pedestrian, the whole plan fell apart due to my misplaced trust in my railway
booking. I had bought my train ticket on a third-party website (12go.asia to be
exact) as one can only book directly through the Indian Railways website with an
Indian phone number. The ticket itself looked fine and official: it had my name
on it and the exact train I wanted to take. It even said "CNF" on it for
"confirmed". However, little did I know that confirmed means next to nothing on
the Indian Railways! Confirmed status is only a placeholder until your allocated
bunk number appears on the ticket, which of course mine never did, and tickets
are usually sold out weeks before the train's departure, so re-booking wasn't an
option. The friendly pedestrian explained all of this and then brought me to a
hole-in-the-wall travel agent in an obscure street somewhere near Connaught
Place. I was dreading this, to be honest, as I knew this was a great opportunity
for someone to make some dough from a tourist with no other options. Although
this is exactly what happened, I'm not too sore about it as the resulting trip
was highly worthwhile and well-removed from anything I would have planned. 

The travel agent was a cheerful and fairly rotund man, who clearly had been
doing this for a long time. He waxed poetically to me about his travels in
England, having been to Chester and surrounds only a few weeks ago. Likewise, he
showed me all of the tourism awards bestowed upon him by the high and mighty of
Indian society. After a short introduction, I explained to him my situation as
well as my general plans for the trip. Of course, he promptly ignored my plan to
spend a few days in Delhi and then go eastwards. Why should I spend time in
Delhi, he said. It's a horrible and polluted city. Now this wasn't exactly
untrue: while I was there, the AQI air quality index was hitting record levels
of pollution (over 400) and the air was smoggy and sulphurous, with a grey haze
hanging over the place. Instead, I should go to Kashmir, he opined. Of course,
the fact that he was Kashmiri and was planning to send me to an acquaintance's
homestay was a pure coincidence, I'm sure. There was a bit of back and forth but
ultimately I relented to his suggestion on the condition that this diversion to
my travel plans only last a few days and that he book my onward train travel.
His colleague then asked for my Booking.com account, where I had already made
all of my hotel bookings for the trip. As I would now be delayed by 4 days,
these all had to be cancelled.  This was no big deal he explained, as they were
experts in coming up with all sorts of excuses (medical etc.) to cancel bookings
without incurring fees. After coughing up payment, padded by a couple hundred
euros I'm sure, I found myself being led into a taxi, headed directly to the
airport for the next flight to Srinigar, departing in an hour and a half.

The flight itself was only about 40 minutes and unremarkable excepting the
beautiful descent into the mountainous vale of Kashmir itself. I did have a
short chat with a woman behind me though, who thought it was insane for a person
to visit Kashmir solo, which I at first found funny, but led me to realise that
the exotic mysticism of the name Kashmir (in my head at least!),
as exemplified by the famous Led Zeppelin song, is overshadowed by the decades of
conflict and unrest in the minds of people here. This was very much confirmed as I stepped out of
the plane and onto the tarmac; the airport seemed more like a military base than a
civilian airport, with armed soldiers patrolling up and down and huge Indian
flags displayed proudly about the place just so we remembered that we're not in Pakistan.
