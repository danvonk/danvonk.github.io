- Yerevan was a one of the more interesting places to visit during trip to caucuses
- In the oldest country in the world
- Beautiful Kentron was built by the command of Stalin
- Elegant, dark, stone buildings look down onto wide tree-lined avenues
- The footpaths curve round flower beds and is more likely to find luxury german cars than anything made in the USSR here
- The apartments have high-ceilings and fine parquet floors

- Of course, the average Armenian is not welcome in a place like this
-
