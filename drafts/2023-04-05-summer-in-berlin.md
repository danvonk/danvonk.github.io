title: A Summer in Berlin on Film

In August 2022, I spent a couple of weeks visiting the office in Berlin and decided
to take my Zorki-4K camera with me. I found a couple of rolls of Kodak _ColorPlus_ in _DM_, so 
decided to use that to capture my explorations of the city in my free-time. 
Although ColorPlus is known as a cheap film, I was quite pleased with the results and although
it doesn't have the fine detail of Kodak _Portra_, I think the colour reproduction is very near
as good. The following blog entry describes a bit of the back-story behind these photos.

For the duration of my time in Berlin, I was staying in Pankow-Sued, just moments
away from the U-Bahn station of _Vinetastrasse_. For Berliners, this is considered to be in Narnia
as it's outside of the _Ringbahn_, the S-Bahn that encircles the core of the city. However, it was
easy enough to walk to one of the stations on the ring and being so close to a metro station, with
which I could reach the city centre in under 20 mins, was quite a contrast to where I live currently,
in the real boonies on the very fringes of the greater London area.

The AirBnb that I was staying in was an _Altbau_. These are apartment buildings that were built during the _Gruenderzeit_,
which began in 1873, with the unification of Germany and lasted till WW1. This was a time when industrialisation
came into full swing in Germany, where it overtook Britain as the foremost power in Europe in this regard, as well
as in science and culture. Predictably then, the buildings of this time are very ornate, with almost 4m high ceilings,
beautiful facades and very large rooms. They are a joy to be in, especially during Summer, when natural light streams
in through their large windows and one can sit on their spacious balconies and observe the goings-on in the city from above.

Due to it being a major hub for the U-Bahn, the first place I visited was _Alexanderplatz_, this is a large open plaza in the former eastern zone of Berlin. It was
completely reconstructed after the second world war by the communist authorities and as such it's surrounded by large, blocky
brutalist buildings, which have now become department shops like _Galeria Kaufhof_ and other mass-market shops. Although the
famous TV tower is not actually on the _Alex_, it is one of the major attractions here. I usually think TV towers are a bit
ugly, but I have to admit, I do quite like this one!

I continued my walk here on the Karl-Marx Allee. This was one of the preeminent streets of the eastern zone. It is a wide
boulevard lined with large apartment buildings in the _Stalinist Architecture_ style. This isn't to be confused with the
typical communist, brutalist style that came later but instead is quite intricate and almost classical in appearance. Other than
that, there were also some nice _Bauhaus_ buildings, but I'm not usually such a fan. 

After a while of walking down this street, you will eventually reach _Friedrichshain_. Friedrichshain is one of the original 'cool' 
parts of Berlin, famed for its night-life and bohemian lifestyle. Although as some locals told me, it's getting a bit tired and yuppie nowadays
and that's something I definitely saw as there were a lot of big office blocks there (e.g. Warner Music) and several more being constructed.
On the day I was there, the famous flea market was on at the _RAW Gelaende_, which sells second-hand clothes, so you can get that trash-chic
vibe that Berlin is known for. The assortment was a lot better for women's clothes and the prices were high.
