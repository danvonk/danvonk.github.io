In November of 2022, I headed to Ankara for a two-week adventure through Turkey and the 
Caucuses with a friend that I have known for many years. It had been a trip many 
months in the making, though it started with a humble suggestion during a Discord chat 
one evening a few months before. Both being relatively early into our careers, we did not have the luxury of spending
money on long-haul flights to the U.S., a week's worth of hotels in an expensive state as well
as the petrol needed to get us around. Nor did the idea of staying in Europe and going to museums
sound all that excited to us adventure-seekers. So instead, it was more a question of how far
we could go for the least money and luckily we found short-haul flights to Ankara that fit the
description well. So our destination had now become Ankara. But ask any Turk and they will tell you that there isn't
much to see in this city. Therefore, we decided to take the night train across the country and continue
this journey into the Caucuses, which I'll probably describe in a further blog post.

When we arrived in Ankara, far form being boring, the city was initially very exciting to be in: Even for someone
who had grown up around London, it seemed huge. I think this was due to the hilly geography of the
city, where the horizon was filled with craggy hills in all directions, which were densely packed
with grey, concrete tenament blocks, all identically dishevelled, with their walls reflecting the yellow sodium-vapour lighting that
is steadily becoming antique elsewhere. Our hotel was perched miday up the hill 
in the old town area of Ankara and the during the night, the views from it looked like someone had taken 
the city scape of Los Angeles, as seen from the hills around the Hollywood sign, scrunched it up into a ball 
and it all creased, unfurled it as a skybox around our hotel room.

The streets themselves were packed with people running their errands. On street corners, men would setup
shop with a picnic table and chair, flogging lottery tickets while people waited for the pedestrian traffic 
light to turn green. Likewise, just in case you were starting to feel hungry, you were never far from someone
selling (perhaps not so) freshly baked Simit bread, which cost 5 or so lira per piece. There were also many
alleyways that turned into bazaars, where one could buy the usual counterfeit junk but also a huge variety of spices
and kitchenware such as teapots, indespensible in Turkey.

But what we found interesting is that this freneticisism was not all-encompassing. Around almost every corner,
there were kebab restaurants which were exactly like the ones back in Germany (not comparable to those grotty 
ones you find in England, whose purpose is to supply greasy food to inebriates at 4 AM), where old blokes would spend
hours talking and smoking. We also tried it, minus the smoking, and found it agreeable. Plus the food was always delicious. 

However, after a while we were ready to leave the chaos of this 'boring city'. In the months before the trip, we stumbled upon, through research on the internet in the months preceding the trip, the _Dogu Express_. This passenger train runs every night from Ankara in the centre of the country, to Kars, which is in the far east, in the Armenian
highlands. Despite its name, the train takes around thirty hours to reach its destination from
Ankara. You may think this means it traverses some collosal distance, but in fact it would only take
13 hours to drive. However, the slowness of the train did not deter us as we had plenty of time and I was rather
looking forward to sleeping on a night train, which I had never done before.

Although the website for the turkish railway company was quite clunky, it wasn't too difficult to book tickets a week
or so before we left for the trip. We decided to be cheeky and book two extra fake guests in the same cabin as us
so that we didn't have worry about being cramped in the cabin with two strangers. We didn't feel too bad as this
was the off-season and there were plenty of other berths available. In all, it cost us about £15 each, making this
a very cheap way to get across the country. If you wanted it even cheaper, you could also get couchettes. However,
we walked through that carriage and found it very musty, hot and humid.

It is also considered sinful in Islam for an unmarried man and woman (including strangers) to sit next to each other,
or sleep in the same cabin, for more than a few hours. This was an annoyance several times on coaches and aeroplanes,
where we were assigned random seats and the attendant had to play _Towers of Hanoi_ to get us into the proper configuration,
but also may pose a problem if you are travelling with someone of the opposite gender.

Our train was one of the newer models and the cabin had air-conditioning and was quite comfy. This was welcome for me
as the night before we had gone out to explore the city, gotten a little drunk and stupidly decided to go for the cheapest
Doener we saw. Needless to say I got food poisning, vomitted quite a lot in the hotel and was green and feverish for the first
night of the train journey. One let-down for me in this unfortunate state, were the toilets. At one end of the carriage, one
could find the squat toilet and at the other end, the western-style toilet. However, the toilet also had a bidet function which could
be turned on via a tap. Naturally someone had left this running, so after a few hours there was no more water in the tank.
This also meant that the flush functionality of the toilet did not work. Luckily the train staff had predicted this and a toilet 
brush was already supplied to shove the waste down through the hole at the bottom of the airplane-style, aluminium bowl. This was all a 
little grim but we had come prepared with wet-wipes, hand sanitiser and turkish _cologne_, which is citrus-flavoured cleaning alcohol, rather than perfume.

The carriage with our cabin was otherwise pretty good. The beds were about 2m long and spongy enough. The quite loud
_c-clank-a-clank_ of the wheels going over the joins in rails took a bit of getting used to but otherwise
became comforting after a while. The carriages did get noisy with those bumps and screeches if we got up to speed, 
but in practice this wasn't really a problem as we barely went over 30mph for most of the trip. Overall the night's sleep was restful.

I woke up the next morning with a beautiful view just beyond my feet. The blinds in the cabin were not quite
opaque so the daylight came seeping in. With it, we saw the deep canyons that we had been traversing the night before.
They were the canyons formed by tributaries to the Tigris river and our train weaved through deep cuts in the sides
of the canyon walls, often through switch-backs where we could see the whole rest of the train.

We had finished the snacks we brought with us on the train the night before, which meant it was time for breakfast.

- Only cup-a-soup, chocolate bars and packaged sandwiches were on offer in the restaurant car
- We spent lots of time in the restauraunt car drinking tea, which was also just lipton teabag. Nothing authentic.
- 8Kek was delicious. The packaged cheese and factory bread-roll not so much.
- Our conductor was also a minor celebrity on the turkish rails and he is the subject of a student short-film.
- We met some fellow travellers on the 'trail' and had long conversations with them on the dining car to pass the time.
- _Your correspondent_ met another correspondent who was a freelance writer for Al Jazeera, who luckily also spoke Turkish
and gave us some more backstory.
- We took the time here to explore the train a bit more and take some photos out of the back of the train.

However, disaster struck when we tried to play top-trumps in the dining car. An old lady spotted us and ratted us out
to the conductor. No gambling allowed. He explained to us, that he knew top-trumps wasn't gambling but it's more about
perception than reality. And he wasn't going to get in trouble with his superiors over it.

- We talked to some other travellers on the journey, including over hot-topics such as the Armenian Genocide.

Before long, it was late evening again. Only in the last few hours of the trip, did we start to become bored and spent the
time by watching films in the cabin as we watched the evening set in over the planes in the Armenian Highlands, were no trees grew. 
We arrived a few hours late in Kars, at around 10PM. It was already dark and about -5C. Ready to continue on the next leg of the journey...
