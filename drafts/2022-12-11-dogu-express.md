In November of 2022, I headed to Ankara for a two-week adventure through Turkey and the 
Caucuses with a friend that I have known for many years. It had been a trip many 
months in the making, though it started with a humble suggestion during a Discord chat 
one evening a few months before. Both being relatively early into our careers, we did not have the luxury of spending
money on long-haul flights to the U.S., a week's worth of hotels in an expensive state as well
as the petrol needed to get us around. Nor did the idea of staying in Europe and going to museums
sound all that excited to us adventure-seekers. So instead, it was more a question of how far
we could go for the least money and luckily we found short-haul flights to Ankara that fit the
description well.

So our destination had now become Ankara. But ask any Turk and they will tell you there isn't
much to see in this city. For us, the city was exciting to be in at first: Even for someone
who had grown up around London, it seemed huge. I think this was due to the hilly geography of the
city, where the horizon was filled with craggy hills in all directions, which were densely packed
with grey, concrete tenament blocks, all identically dishevelled. Our hotel was perched upon the hill 
in the old town area of Ankara and the during the night, the views from it looked like someone had taken 
the city scape of Los Angeles, as seen from the hills around the Hollywood sign, scrunched it up into a ball 
and it all creased, unfurled it as a skybox around our hotel room.

The streets themselves were packed with people running their errands. On street corners, men would setup
shop with a picnic table and chair, flogging lottery tickets while people waited for the pedestrian traffic light to turn green.

But what we found interesting is the that this attitude did not encompass everything. 

So to complement our holiday to this 'boring city', we stumbled upon, through research on the internet in the months preceding the trip, 
the _Dogu Express_. This passenger train runs every night from Ankara in the centre of the country, to Kars, which is in the far east, in the Armenian
highlands. Despite its name, the train takes around thirty hours to reach its destination from
Ankara. You may think this means it traverses some collosal distance, but in fact it would only take
13 hours to drive. However, the slow

However, not only is this train a visa-free, miniture Trans-Siberian, but it also crosses through
some of  Turkey's most scenic terrain: starting in Cappadocia, through gentle hills, then through
impressive canyons in Erzincan Province and following the path of the Tigris and Euphrates.

The train itself was clean and modern. Our cabin was air-conditioned, with a  

- It was cheap
- 15 euros equivalent to book one side of a cabin (2 beds).
- Perhaps not allowed but the train was empty in the off season
- Cabin was nice. Air conditioned (kind of)

- Only cup-a-soup, chocolate bars and packaged sandwiches were on offer in the restaurant car
- also no card games of any kind permitted

<!-- We had been talking over Discord in the evenings, searching  -->

<!-- Once we touched down in Ankara, the preconceived simulation of the trip that I had been imagining and living during the idle moments of the workday immediately disappeared. We were plonked down into a bustling city, the size of which I had not previously experienced. London can be a busy place if you go looking for it, around the train stations during rush hour, or if you are so unfortunate to walk from a quiet alleyway, hiding there since the middle ages, onto Oxford Street. But London is flat and it hides its size well; the sight-lines are managed and pedicured. -->

<!-- In Ankara, large, rocky hills dominate the skyline, they being almost entirely built up with concrete tenement buildings, stretching off into the horizon, the buildings are covered in soot and dirt, baked in by the hot sun. Down on the street level, the roads are traffic jammed with old clunkers and the pavements likewise chock-full and alive. People crowd around street vendors sitting behind picnic tables, which are stacked with lotto tickets, everyone hoping to win. Dogs and cats are found through the quieter alleyways, either commuting or relaxing in front of shop windows. -->

<!-- This freneticisism was exciting to be in for a couple of days, but thankfully the day soon came for us to board the Dogu Express. The train leaves Ankara Station in the evening daily, so  -->
