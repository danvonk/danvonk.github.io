see the border fence which now places it in Turkey. ")

Already preceding my entry into Armenia, had I heard accusations and assertions
about this place. Indeed, on the train journey to Kars, a town in Turkey, near
to the border with Armenia, we had been conversing with a Turkish man who, when
we told him that we were going to Armenia, made sure to explain that we would
hear much about the Armenian genocide, but that it simply wasn't true. After
all, the Ottoman Empire was a powerful entity he stressed to us, surely if they
wanted to exterminate the Armenian people, they would have done so thoroughly
and without any half-measures? 

This piqued my interest...

Ani")

Secondly, when we arrived in the border town of Kars, we found it to have a
different atmosphere than the other Turkish cities we visited and we started to
get glimpses of the Armenian culture. Scattered around
the place, were remnants of past Armenian and later, Russian architecture. These
structures are distinctive, built with basalt stone in a rounded-arch style,
similar to what westerners today consider as byzantine architecture. 

In Kars, we took a bus out to the ruins of the old medieval city of _Ani_, a
UNESCO heritage site. This once-city lays on the austere plains of the _Armenian Highlands_ , where it is
protected on one side by the dramatic canyon created by the _Arkhurian_ river,
shown in the image above, and a valley on the other side. Once a bustling place,
founded around the 5th century, it was a trading centre with the Byzantines,
Arabs and the Persians. It was home to cathedrals, churches of both the Armenian
and Georgian kind, mosques and public squares; all contained in imposing city
walls. However, already in the 11th century, was it sacked by the Seljuk
Turks and in the following centuries also the Mongols. Today just a few of its
buildings survive standing interspersed amongst a whole lot of rubble. Instead
the greatest landmark here is the skyscraper-sized Turkish flag erected just
beside the site and right on the border. Proudly displaying the extent of the
Turkish landmass.^[We also saw huge flags from Azerbijan on the trip.]
