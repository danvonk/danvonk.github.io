<p>Despite Oman having a long history, there wasnâ€™t much evident of it in the
capital city Muscat, which is a city caught between being a hectic
middle-eastern metropolis and a resort town for rich oil-sheiks, depending on
where you are and your station in life. Therefore, in search of some history, I
took a coach out to Nizwa, a major city and oasis town in the desert interior of
the country.</p>

<p>Mustcat, Oman, is a busy city of about one and a half million people. In districts like
Al-Gubrah, it has wide, traffic-jammed boulevards lined with tall concrete
buildings. There often isnâ€™t any pavement but instead the side of the road is a
car park for the shops on the ground floor. The sun was scorching when I
visited in October and the temperature around 39c. Therefore, I wanted to stay
in the shade as much as possible and that meant keeping close to the shop
fronts. However, the more I walked around, the more amusing I found the names of
the shops!</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the trip to Kyrgyzstan was taking the UAZ, the
go-anywhere vehicle, up into the remote fringes of the country. It was the type
of journey for which the van was designed and I was not disappointed! The
scenery encountered along the way remains some of the best Iâ€™ve ever seen and
being able to drive around essentially anywhere unrestricted or meeting
much sign of human life remains a priceless experience for me.</p>
<p>The aim of the journey was to see Kolâ€™su lake, an alpine lake hidden
between the peaks of the central Tian Shan mountain range, which separate
Kyrgyzstan from China. The lake itself sits at an elevation of 3514 metres.
The lake itself has an air of mystical quality about it: Kolâ€™su was formed by a
seismic event in the 1970s and has no proper outflow. Nevertheless water
manages to escape underground through cracks in the rock formations and through soil. This
causes it to occasionally dry out entirely, before it can be resupplied by the
Kurumduk river.</p>

<p>On my recent trip to Kyrgyzstan, one of the highlights was the beautiful
Barskoon Valley. On the south shore of Lake Issyk-Kul, sits the town of Barskoon
and this road brings you up into the Tien-Shan mountains and beyond. Somewhat
unusual for Kyrgyzstan, is that this road doesnâ€™t totally suck! We managed to do
about 90 km/h in our UAZ on this dirt track, while we could only manage about 20
km/h when we were travelling in the south of the country around Naryn.</p>

<p>After a long winter and a damp spring, by April, it was finally time for a
holiday and the chosen venue this time was Morocco. For me, there is a particular
allure to leaving Europe and vacationing in a new continent and I have barely
scratched the surface of Africa so far in my life. Furthermore, the decision to travel to
Morocco was further spurred on by the fact that Ryanair flew to several
destinations in the country for less than $40, which is certainly a price that
canâ€™t be argued with! Amongst those options, my friend and I chose to fly to
Essaouira, a small fishing town on the Atlantic coast, about midway down the
length of the country.</p>

            <p>In August 2022, I spent a couple of weeks visiting the office in Berlin and decided
to take my Zorki-4K camera with me. I found a couple of rolls of Kodak <em>ColorPlus</em> in <em>DM</em>, so
decided to use that to capture my explorations of the city in my free-time.
Although ColorPlus is known as a cheap film, I was pleased with the results and although
it doesnâ€™t have the fine detail of Kodak <em>Portra</em>, I think the colour reproduction is very near
as good. The following blog entry describes a bit of the back-story behind these photos.</p>
