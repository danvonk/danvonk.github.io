<p>Mustcat, Oman, is a busy city of about one and a half million people. In districts like
Al-Gubrah, it has wide, traffic-jammed boulevards lined with tall concrete
buildings. There often isn’t any pavement but instead the side of the road is a
car park for the shops on the ground floor. The sun was scorching when I
visited in October and the temperature around 39c. Therefore, I wanted to stay
in the shade as much as possible and that meant keeping close to the shop
fronts. However, the more I walked around, the more amusing I found the names of
the shops!</p>

<p>On my recent trip to Kyrgyzstan, one of the highlights was the beautiful
Barskoon Valley. On the south shore of Lake Issyk-Kul, sits the town of Barskoon
and this road brings you up into the Tien-Shan mountains and beyond. Somewhat
unusual for Kyrgyzstan, is that this road doesn’t totally suck! We managed to do
about 90 km/h in our UAZ on this dirt track, while we could only manage about 20
km/h when we were travelling in the south of the country around Naryn.</p>

<p>After a long winter and a damp spring, by April, it was finally time for a
holiday and the chosen venue this time was Morocco. For me, there is a particular
allure to leaving Europe and vacationing in a new continent and I have barely
scratched the surface of Africa so far in my life. Furthermore, the decision to travel to
Morocco was further spurred on by the fact that Ryanair flew to several
destinations in the country for less than $40, which is certainly a price that
can’t be argued with! Amongst those options, my friend and I chose to fly to
Essaouira, a small fishing town on the Atlantic coast, about midway down the
length of the country.</p>

            <p>In August 2022, I spent a couple of weeks visiting the office in Berlin and decided
to take my Zorki-4K camera with me. I found a couple of rolls of Kodak <em>ColorPlus</em> in <em>DM</em>, so
decided to use that to capture my explorations of the city in my free-time.
Although ColorPlus is known as a cheap film, I was pleased with the results and although
it doesn’t have the fine detail of Kodak <em>Portra</em>, I think the colour reproduction is very near
as good. The following blog entry describes a bit of the back-story behind these photos.</p>

<p>The best photo I have taken has to be the one shown above, which I took in September 2019. I was travelling with a friend
from San Francisco, down to L.A. and then back up again. We had rented a Nissan pick-up truck, or really I should, as a self-respecting
Aussie, say Ute, which was of course a novelty for us compared to the “euro shitboxes” one mostly sees back at home. We were around
the Yosemite / Death Valley area and had found a lay-by off a forest road which was in an isolated spot, perched up on the gentle
gradient leading down to Mono Lake in the distance.</p>

<p>Already preceding my entry into Armenia, had I heard accusations and assertions
about this place. It was on the train journey to Kars, a town in Turkey, near
to the border with Armenia, had we been conversing with a Turkish man who, when
we told him we were going to Armenia, made sure to explain that we would
hear much about the Armenian genocide, but that it simply wasn’t true. After
all, the Ottoman Empire was a powerful entity, he stressed to us, surely if they
wanted to exterminate the Armenian people, they would have done so thoroughly
and without any half-measures?</p>
