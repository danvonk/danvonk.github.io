<p>Georgia is a land of stunning geography but one of the highlights for me was our
tour starting in the capital and driving the <em>Military Highway</em> through the
Caucuses mountains up to Gudauri, which is a ski resort town. This road is
steeped in the history of the region, having been used by invaders and merchants since at
least the first century BC.</p>

            <p>Many Linux users settle on whatever their desktop environment their distro
provides. Then there are others are endlessly tinkeringâ€“that was me. However,
for the last couple of years, Iâ€™ve settled on what I think is a happy
middle-ground between the flexibility of a tiling WM like <code>sway</code> and the
usability of <code>GNOME</code> or <code>KDE</code>.</p>

<p>In November of 2022, I headed to Ankara for a two-week adventure through Turkey
and the Caucuses with a friend that I have known for many years. It had been a
trip months in the making, though it started with a humble suggestion during a
Discord chat one evening. Both being relatively early into our careers, we did
not have the luxury of spending money on long-haul flights to the U.S., a weekâ€™s
worth of hotels in an expensive state as well as the petrol needed to get us
around. Nor did the idea of staying in Europe and going to museums sound all
that excited to us adventure-seekers. So instead, it was more a question of how
far we could go for the least money and luckily, through browsing on Google
Flights, we found short-haul flights to Ankara that fit the description well. So
our destination had now become Ankara. But ask any Turk and they will tell you
that there isnâ€™t much to see in this city. Therefore, we decided to take the
night train across the country and continue this journey into the Caucuses,
which Iâ€™ll probably describe in a further blog post.</p>
